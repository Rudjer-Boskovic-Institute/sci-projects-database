Current application of bacteria in the environment is hindered by the lack of knowledge on the effects of stresses on cellular activity, most importantly abiotic stresses prevailing on site (e.g., desiccation or nutrient starvation), stresses as a result of pollution itself (e.g., toxicity), and those during strain preparation and formulation. BACSIN proposes four iterative poles of research and technology to overcome this hindrance for subsequent improved microbial usage. The 1st pole will investigate genome-wide catabolic and stress expression in a set of different pollutant degrading bacteria (the ‘BACSINs’). Key cellular factors and regulatory networks determining the interplay between stress-survival and pollutant catabolism will be unveiled, and faithful predictive models for cell behaviour produced. The 2nd pole will study stress resistance, survival and activity of BACSINs in real polluted environments, via microcosms and in situ ‘traps’, plant roots and leaves, while accentuating possible effects on native communities. The 3d pole will focus on the original microbial communities at contaminated sites, to discover and exploit more optimal stress and survival resistance among resident pollutant-degrading bacteria.

Networking and information sharing The objective is to stimulate the networking and the sharing of information between organisations involved in agri-economics analysis. The networking will be stimulated through the organisation of 3 symposia and 6 workshops and the development of a dynamic web site including an up-dated directories of experts and organisations. 2. Provide scientific input for policy making The objective is to provide analyses on a number of specific topics (8-monthly as well as “report on demand”). 3. Prepare future analysis The objective is to prepare for future policy and sectoral analyses and research by collecting quantitative and qualitative information. In the NMS, 3 monitoring reports of agricultural and rural will be prepared. In the WBC, a study on the existing availability of key agricultural and rural statistics will be prepared. 4. Develop analytical capacities The objective is to strengthen the analytical capabilities of the research organisations involved in the project in the field of policy evaluation and foresight analysis. This will be achieved by implementing training sessions as well as conducting pilot studies. AgriPolicy will be implemented by a team of experts from 24 organisations from 24 countries.

Hunting is embedded in social structures and cultural patterns and has a key role in conflicts over natural resource management around the world. Our multidisciplinary team will assess the social, cultural, economic and ecological functions and impacts of hunting across a range of contexts in Europe and Africa. Our study systems fall across economic gradients from the richest to the poorest countries and encompass environments from the Arctic to the Equator. We seek to understand what influences attitudes to hunting, how these attitudes influence and determine individual and societal behaviour in relation to hunting, and finally, how hunting behaviour influences biodiversity.

They are typically made of two thin metal sheets with an insulating core between the faces. The use of sandwich panels is continuously increasing and new application areas are opened in industrial, residential and office buildings. The European Standard for sandwich panels EN 14509 has a lack of rules or requirements for many important areas like fastening of the panels, openings in panels, axially loaded panels and panels stabilizing frame structures. Despite there is a lot of knowledge in different countries on these subjects, no common rules have been developed, thus putting a hinder to the standardisation and leading to barriers for some of these applications.The aim of this project is to overcome these problems and develop solutions and technical guidelines ready for implementation for the revision of the standard EN 14509 which is expected to be finished in 2010. The second goal of the project is to implement the new information in the use in practice, which will be carried out through seminars and practical guidelines as well as e-learning modules. The subjects are of high industrial and user interest. The project introduces guidelines for topics not included in the present version of the standard but will on the base of this research be implemented in a later revision of the standard. The subjects are very important in practice. Practical guidelines and seminars will help and broaden the correct and safe use of sandwich panels in Europe and ICPC.

The magnetic moment of the scaffolds enables them with a fascinating possibility of being continuously controlled and reloaded from external supervising center with all needed scaffold materials and various active factors (AF).

EE develops physical indicators and indices, provides economic valuation of environmental services and negative externalities, applies tools of multi-criteria evaluation to resource use, and promotes environmental policy instruments such as eco-taxes and marketable permits. To provide policy makers with high quality, relevant research, increased collaboration between ecological economists and CSOs is needed. Many CSOs already have a large stock of environmental knowledge but need increased capacity in EE to give an analytical foundation to activism and policy making. The social and disciplinary divide between CSO and academic research poses significant challenges. At the same time, there are real-world demands from CSOs for knowledge of EE – for instance, to assess the liability of companies in oil extraction conflicts, to evaluate plans for palm oil plantations for biofuel exports, or to establish alternative energy plans at the regional level. This project addresses CSO capacity weakness in EE through a number of coordinated activities. The focus is not on theory but on case study learning. Joint working groups will identify and report on key issues for research in water management, mining, energy, forestry and agriculture, based on CSO needs and interests. Previous cooperative research activities will be reviewed and assessed in terms of their effectiveness in meeting CSO needs, and documented and disseminated.

It generates similar quantities of waste water, to be treated, and substantial CO2 emissions (3,8 million tons CO2/year). The annual turnover of the sector is 5,1 billion euro, which can be doubled if all disposable textile articles were replaced by environmentally friendly reusable items. Focused and coordinated research to develop and improve innovative technologies can greatly enhance the performance of the sector. The conventional laundry processes are characterized by large enthalpy destructions and resource inefficiencies. It is the purpose of the project to design the SMART LAUNDRY-2015 through research, further development and adaptation of 16 key technologies (combined for green sites or individual for existing plant augmentation). These include water reduction, energy savings, green fuel substitutions for CO2 reductions, new energy systems and improved sequencing of the processes, greater textile hyiene. Full implementation of the SMART LAUNDRY-2015 will reduce the annual water consumptions by at least 10,4 million m3 (30%), the energy consumptions by 27,5 PJ (45%) and the overall CO2 emissions by 2,3 million tons CO2 per year (60% reduction) at 100% market penetration in the year 2015. Improved laundry services with the 16 key technologies and practices will enhance reusable textiles and reduce the throwaways and disposables by 20%. The 16 key technologies will be investigated at pilot scale level and subsequently integrated in a unified design. A parallel benchmarking and innovation monitoring will validate both the actual energy demand and the potential of energy savings of the future innovations. Future economic gains from SMILES are projected at 1020 million EUR in the next 10 years. An important component of project SMILES is the educational effort and training of key staff members and hand-on workers to assist in the introduction of the Smart Laundry-2015. The project also encompasses the writing, production and dissemination of key materials by a special website (smartlaundry2015.com) to national associations and to all SMEs in the sector. Finally the resource reductions are assured by an automated energy management system controlling and monitoring input and output savings.

Their major objective is to collect and distribute river related information in order to support not only public waterways authorities, but also commercial operators in the Inland Waterway Transport (IWT) sector. The use of such information for logistics purposes is still quite under-exploited. RISING will investigate how such information can lead to useful solutions and services supporting complete transport chains involving inland waterways transport.\n\nFor this purpose, existing RIS will be equipped with additional intelligent software modules. In addition, transport operators´ chain planning, execution and monitoring systems will gain the ability to implement such information into their planning and monitoring processes. On top of improved tracking and tracing capabilities, new concepts, such as Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM), will be used to facilitate automated chain monitoring such that chain managers are informed only when manual intervention is required for cargo to move properly. These new modules and their interaction with systems for chain planning and execution will be implemented according to the framework architecture and mode independent information exchange principles laid out in the Freightwise project. In order to make IWT a part of the co-modal transport chain, this mode must be able to supply at least the same quality services as all other transport modes.\n\nTherefore services need to be developed and offered in a harmonised way - harmonised across borders, as well as between different modes. A key results of RISING is a harmonised set of events, messages and services to be offered for providing RIS information to the logistics chain operators using inland waterway transport.

Moreover, due to its closeness to the European research community, the European Commission perceives the NCP Network as an important instrument for gathering feedback on possible problems and difficulties in the implementation of the Framework Programme. One of the great strengths of the NCP system is its national orientation and ability to provide support to applicants in their own native language. This is carried out by experts that are not only well versed in the modalities of the Framework Programme, but, as a rule, also possess keen knowledge of the national research landscape in their respective fields. On the other hand, however, this national orientation poses certain problems. The decentralised system organised and financed nationally has led to the development of a collection of heterogeneous structures. In an effort to address the weaknesses described above, the project proposal PeopleNetwork aims at the development and implementation of a coordination mechanism for stimulating closer cooperation among National Contact Points for the PEOPLE programme in the Seventh Framework Programme.

Wind energy can be a significant part of the answer. The new frontier of the wind industry is large-scale offshore wind farms. While promising, considerable research and development tasks remain to be carried out before it reaches its full potential in terms of the efficient, stable, safe, predictable and controllable supply of energy. Closed loop control of wind power installations has historically been decentralized and a collection of wind turbines in farms is a highly complex system with interdependencies through the shared resource, the wind. Wind turbines are affected by the wind but they also changes the wind field within the farm through the control. To address objectives related to cost, quality of power and mechanical loads, models and control paradigms must be developed that allow wind resource allocation to individual turbines. Inspired by the industrial case of complex large-scale distributed offshore wind farms, the Aeolus project will research and develop models that allow real-time predictions of flows and incorporate measurements from a set of spatially distributed sensor devices. In Aeolus we will use the flow information as a basis for new control paradigms, centralized and distributed that acknowledges the uncertainty in the modelling and dynamically manages the flow resource in order to optimise specific control objectives. The model and control principles are used for control of a wind power farm to increase energy quality and reduce the fatigue loads.

It focuses on knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship as a necessary mechanism and an agent of change mediating between the creation of knowledge and its transformation into economic activity. Knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship is perceived herein as a core interface between two interdependent systems: the knowledge generation and diffusion system, on the one hand, and the productive system, on the other. Both systems shape and are shaped by the broader social context – including customs, culture, and institutions – thus also pointing at the linkage of entrepreneurship to that context. The project has three main objectives (research thrusts). At the micro level, it purports to study in depth the very act of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship, its defining characteristics, boundaries, scope and incentives.

The innovation lies in the elaboration of a more reliable damage assessment by connecting the future climate data with whole building simulation models and new damage assessment functions. In situ measurements at UNESCO sites throughout Europe will allow a much more precise and integrated assessment of the real damage impact of climate change on cultural heritage. Appropriate sustainable mitigation/adaptation strategies, also from previous projects, are further developed and applied on the basis of these findings simultaneously. All these results will be incorporated into an assessment of the economic impacts. In order to ensure an efficient use of resources, this project will build on the results of already concluded EU research projects (Noah’s Ark). Techniques from FP5/6 projects will be reassessed for their applicability in future scenarios at different regions in Europe and Mediterranean to fully meet sustainability criteria.

Out of all the causes, most of them are minimised or preventable by better maintenance except the overloading of the electricity main (Power Grids), which can’t be completely predicted. Across Europe, overloading of the mains occurs more frequently and this in impacted by the fact that energy consumption in the EU is growing and this has significant environmental impacts. There are various measures taken to tackle the overloading of the mains, including predicting when these overloads occur and preparing back up power to cater for it, however, this solution would only help in minimising it. There will still be some cases of overloading especially due to the fluctuations of the demand on the mains. All the time, Power Grids must ensure that electricity supply precisely matches the continually changing demand from the vast amount of customers. Although most of the large changes in demand are predictable there are continuous smaller fluctuations which are essentially random. And there is also always the possibility that a sudden large fluctuation could occur at any time and the sudden increased demand can cause a power line or generating station to fail. Trying to control this issue costs the Grids hundreds millions of euros, and in some cases there have been the occurrence of blackouts in some countries. There is a need for an innovative approach to reduce the pressure being put on the Grids by effectively managing the energy consumption and demand on the Grid with the incorporation of Dynamic Demand technology. Therefore our concept is to develop an innovative Power Management System, which when the demand on the Grid is low would store accessible power that can be used later to allow flexible disconnection of various appliances from the Grid when the demand on it is high.''', 879518.00, 659560.00, 'FP7-SME-2008-1', 'BSG-SME', 'THE UK INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH INSTITUTE LIMITED', 'UK', 'BRODARSKI INSTITUT DOO*BI;GDF SUEZ MARKETING LTD;ENINVEST SA;Energy Optimizers Limited;ISA - Intelligent Sensing Anywhere S.A.;INELECMA S.L.', 'HR;UK;RO;PT;ES', 998923849, 'ECO;SCI'),

Typically, the wind around buildings is too turbulent and slow to be of much use. Normal turbines need to be placed high above them which is expensive and attracts planning objections. If buildings could be used to augment turbine airspeeds, it’s estimated that the potential for energy capture in the built environment could exceed 10 TWh, creating CO2 savings of approximately 4 Megatonnes by 2020. We will develop a retro-fittable roof-mounted module that will be almost invisible from street level. It will accentuate the low pressure zone over a flat roof parapet and link it to high-pressure static air beneath using a tapered duct. The air speed in such a duct has been shown to exceed the free wind by more than 30%. Power increases with the square of air velocity, so a turbine in this region will generate more than double the power of a conventional turbine, and as a ducted fan it will cause significantly less noise and vibration. Further, we will use passively-warmed air injection to create a vortex in the duct, raising generator output by another 40%. The vortex can heat or chill air directly which, coupled to powered passive ventilation, might augment a building’s air conditioning and offset power consumption, cutting payback time still further. The potential EU market for building integrated wind turbines is €345m and we believe that we can capture a high proportion (20%) of it. Conventional wind turbines typically have payback periods of 15-30 years (depending on location) and our system has the potential to reduce this to 5 years. Regardless of the level of augmentation, this approach will significantly improve urban wind power viability and make wind power possible in wind-rich but planning-sensitive areas such as seaside towns and national park hillsides for the first time.''', 1394042.00, 1049975.25, 'FP7-SME-2008-1', 'BSG-SME', 'Torclad Limited', 'UK', 'BRODARSKI INSTITUT DOO*BI;Point L - Bulgaria Ltd;ECLECTIC ENERGY LIMITED;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT;SolarVenti Limited;THE UK MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE LIMITED;"Bioinnova Proyectos Sostenibles, S.L."', 'HR;BG;UK;NL;DK;ES', 998116130, 'ECO;SCI'),

As a result, the market demand is leading to Ultra Large Container Ships (ULCS), which have a capacity up to 14,000 TEU with length up to 400 m, without changes of the operational requirements (speed around 27 knots). The particular structural design of the container ships, leads to open midship sections, resulting in increased sensitivity to torsional and horizontal bending loads which is much more complex to model. At the same time, due to their large dimensions, the ULCS become much “softer” and their structural natural frequencies become significantly lower so that the global hydroelastic structural responses (springing & whipping) can become a critical issue in the ship design and should be properly modelled by the simulation tools.\nOn the other hand, it appears that the existing simulation tools do not provide the definite answer to all these design issues and there is a clear need for their improvement.\nThe particular importance of whipping and the insufficient knowledge in its modelling is clearly reflected in the recent MAIB (Marine Accident Investigation Branch) report, following the loss of theMSC Napoli container ship:\n“It is likely that the hull of MSC Napoli was subjected to additional load due to whipping.”\n“… it is apparent that whipping effect is currently very difficult to reliably calculate or model.”\n“In view of the potential increase in wave loading due to whipping effect, further research is required to ensure that the effect is adequately accounted for in ship design and structural analyses, and that sufficient allowance is made for the effect when determining design margins.”\nThe final goal of the project is to deliver clearly validated design tools and guidelines, capable of analysing all hydro-structure interaction problems relevant to ULCS.''', 4017342.60, 2718482.00, 'FP7-SST-2008-RTD-1', 'CP-FP', 'BUREAU VERITAS-REGISTRE INTERNATIONAL DE CLASSIFICATION DE NAVIRES ET D AERONEFS SA', 'FR', 'UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA;ECOLE CENTRALE DE MARSEILLE;HYDROCEAN;"Sveuciliste u Zagrebu, Fakultet strojarstva i brodogradnje";"SIREHNA - SOCIETE D''INGENIERIE, DE RECHERCHES ET D''ETUDES EN HYDRODYNAMIQUE NAVALE SA";STICHTING MARITIEM RESEARCH INSTITUUT NEDERLAND;CANAL DE EXPERIENCIAS HIDRODINAMICAS DE EL PARDO;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT;DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET;WIKKI LIMITED;CMA CGM;ODENSE STAALSKIBSVAERFT AS;BRZE VISE BOLJE d.o.o.', 'UK;FR;HR;NL;ES;DK', 999948945, 'SEC');

The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by €257 million and profits by €51 million.''', 3083088.40, 2294422.66, 'FP7-SME-2008-2', 'BSG-SME-AG', '"ASSOCIATION EUROPEENNE DES VEHICULES ELECTRIQUES A BATTERIES, HYBRIDES ET A PILE A COMBUSTIBLE"', 'BE', '"Association suisse des vehicules routiers electriques et efficients, e''mobile";MORAVSKOSLEZSKY AUTOMOBILOVY KLASTR OS;GREEN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES LTD;AVIA INGENIERIA Y DISEGNO;Scimar Engineering Ltd;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;ASSOCIATION EUROPEENNE DES VEHICULES ELECTRIQUES ROUTIERS;Cogent Technology Ltd;THE UK INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH INSTITUTE LIMITED;John Bradshaw Limited;EXAGON ENGINEERING SARL;METALLISATION LIMITED;NOVAMINA CENTAR INOVATIVNIH TEHNOLOGIJA DOO', 'CH;CZ;UK;ES;BE;FR;HR', 998331761, 'ECO;SCI'),

Aerospace industry, automotive industry, medical implants, hi-end equipments industry, consumer products, protection and safety are the target sectors –which include more than a million of European enterprises in real need of customized product. Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) -also known as Free Form Fabrication and formerly Rapid Manufacturing-, is a novel fabrication method of parts directly from the electronic model by layer manufacturing, using active principles such as laser and Electron beams. Currently, ALM is the first and the best option for short series of customized products. However, layered manufacturing is not without challenges. Part properties, dimensional accuracy and surface quality depend strongly on process planning, and sometimes prevent ALM parts to be considered as fully functional. The objective of KARMA is to respond to above mentioned challenges with a knowledge-based engineering system (KBE) that can estimate functional properties of ALM parts automatically and in short time. The KBE system would define the optimal production parameters automatically and execute a virtual test of the fabricated part. The KBE system will include a database with characterized material and part properties for all major ALM technologies. The development of such a KBE system is a difficult and demanding task, which will involve both ALM users and companies from the final customer sectors.

Media structures which are free of interference from government, business or other social groups, and in which access of diverse views and opinions is effectively guaranteed, support democratic debate and sustain citizens’ active involvement in political and civic life.\n\nGiven the strong interconnection between politics, business and the media, the creation and safeguarding of an environment supportive of media freedom and independence remain everywhere in Europe a continuous and open-ended process. In view of the important role the media play in providing information about the economy and political affairs, political and economic actors, but also socio-cultural elites regularly seek to exert an influence on domestic media policy-making.\n\nMEDIADEM seeks to understand and explain the factors that promote (or conversely hinder) the development of policies for free and independent media. The project will combine a country-based study in Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey and the UK with a comparative analysis across media sectors and types of media services, and will investigate the complex array of policy approaches and regulatory and self-regulatory practices established to safeguard media freedom and independence. In order to verify whether regulatory measures actually advance a more democratic political order through the diversification of media outlets, sources and content, the project will place them in their proper socio-political, economic and cultural context, and will examine how state and non-state perceptions about the role the media should play in contemporary society influence the implementation of the norms enacted. External pressures stemming from the action of regional organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the EU, will also be investigated in detail. The central assumption of MEDIADEM is that economic, socio-political and cultural domestic peculiarities greatly affect how legal norms are interpreted and implemented, how they are perceived and received, and whether they are truly respected. Simultaneously, given the substantial changes brought by new technologies regarding the way citizens obtain information, the project will examine the opportunities and challenges posed by new media services for media freedom and independence.\n\nThe project will make a significant contribution to media policy development by advancing knowledge on how media freedom and independence can be safeguarded in Europe.

The bottlenecks arise from the present lack of up-scalable processes that can meet the needs for nanomaterials in PV applications, and the lack of relevant equipment and industrial lines. In order to remove these bottlenecks, the main objectives of NanoPV are: 1) To develop technologies that can increase the efficiency and reduce the processing cost of existing silicon solar cell technologies using nano-scale effects provided by nanomaterials to above 20% for wafer based and above 15 % for thin film silicon based solar cells at a processing cost for modules well below 1 €/watt. 2) To design and to fabricate low cost solar cells entirely from nanomaterials by using nanostructures. An efficiency of above 10 % at processing costs well below 1 €/watt is targeted with potential of further significant improvements in the future. 3) To develop up-scalable cost effective processes and equipment in order to implement both enhanced standard solar cells and solar cell based on nanomaterials as well as related modules to existing pilot lines. 4) To create new market opportunities for the industrial partners. Nanotechnology will be applied for both already existing conventional Si solar cells (wafer and thin-film based) and for advanced solar cells entirely based on nanostructures.

This proposal focuses on the real-time power imbalance in the power net, which arises as a consequence of errors in the prediction of both production and demand. As this power imbalance will increase both in size and in frequency, presents arrangements to cope with this imbalance are no longer valid. They are neither reliable nor economic anymore.

This design is based on a distributed control structure, enabled by a fast ICT infrastructure and advanced control theory to reliably and economically deal with the necessary ancillary services. Decisions by consumers, producers, power exchanges and TSOs can be taken locally, based on local or national preferences and regulation. Still, the embedded incentives of the proposed framework can guarantee that all these local decisions together contribute to the global objectives of the EE power net: a reliable electric energy supply at the lowest costs.\\nInstead of investing in additional expensive and environment-unfriendly reserve production or storage facilities with a low utilization rate, the reliability and economy are enforced by intelligent ICT and control.', 3391011.00, 2448000.00, 'FP7-ICT-2009-4', 'CP', 'TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN', 'NL', 'TENNET TSO BV;ABB SCHWEIZ AG;APX B.V.;SCUOLA IMT (ISTITUZIONI, MERCATI, TECNOLOGIE) ALTI STUDI DI LUCCA;O.R.S.

Perhaps this is because many universities in this region retain remnants of the old socialist approach to medical education and research. Because of the limited internal resources, most of the training of the young investigators has been accomplished in the laboratories of Western countries. Although this tradition has proven to be beneficial, it has led to loss of promising scientists to faculty positions and slowed the development of a modern biomedical research. Furthermore, translational research has not been a traditional area of research in Croatia. Correction of these roadblocks can be accomplished by upgrading the research capacity and by expanding the cooperation between scientists from Croatia and those in the EU. Such an approach has already been successfully applied in several instances and is continuing to propel an increase in the research capacity at the University of Rijeka. However, it is of great importance to stress that the expansion of clinical research activities is still lagging behind basic research. The Faculty of Medicine (MEDRI) has already well-developed programs in life sciences, a respectable infrastructure, and ongoing international collaborations. The following steps in research capacity building are to further strengthen the collaboration between investigators at MEDRI and the EU countries, organize and develop formal training programmes for investigators and implement an efficient program of research capacity building with emphasis on the translational medicine in cancer and infectious diseases. Thus, several activities are proposed to synchronize training of researchers with efforts to upgrade and establish research facilities to be used by several research groups and departments.

So far, it has been harvested mostly by wind towers, which use only wind currents close to the ground (bellow 200m of height). Since low altitude wind currents are slow and intermittent, most wind farms operate, on average, 25-35% of their capacity. This represents a severe limitation to current state-of-art wind power technology, as towers can hardly be taller than 130m without prohibitive costs and insurmountable technical difficulties.\nTo bypass these difficulties, it is proposed to perform R&D in a multitude of technology fields such as materials, aerodynamics and control, further developing a wind power system capable of harnessing the energy potential of high altitude wind without the need for heavy towers or expensive elevated nacelles: we call it HAWE (High Altitude Wind Energy).\nHAWE consists of a buoyant, rotating, cylinder shaped, airship, anchored to a ground station by a tether cable operating a two phase cycle. During the power production phase the Magnus effect on the rotating cylinder generates lift, pulling up the tether cable which, at the ground station, is in a winch drum driving a flywheel connected to an alternator producing electricity. When the tether cable is fully unwound, the recovery phase starts - as the cylinder rotation ceases and the cable is reeled back to its initial position decoupled from the flywheel, completing a cycle. This is performed continuously.\nThe successful implementation of this concept will increase the share of renewable energy in Europe since, the achievement of the goal to produce renewable energy at competitive prices with coal derived energy, should lower its cost.

However despite these growth rates, the proportion of RES used for domestic heating and hot water is still under one percent. The main barrier is the high equipment and installation cost of the technology. In addition solar thermal yields cannot always be optimally utilised in existing hot water and heating systems. This is due to the limited size and operating temperature range of conventional thermal energy stores. Increasing the contribution of RES will also necessitate larger thermal stores, which is often difficult due to space and cost constraints. Although higher density Phase Change Materials (PCM) show promising results, they have not been proven to deliver real improvements in domestic applications. In PipeStore, we propose to develop a modular and low cost thermal storage technology, based on a ‘pipes-in-a-pipe’ configuration that can contain a range of PCMs. These will have different melting temperatures, enabling the storage of lower grade thermal energy. This will increase the effective utilisation of a typical solar system by up to twenty percent. Furthermore, a novel actuation and control system will facilitate the use of supercooled PCMs. This will be enable optimal energy storage with a controlled rapid thermal discharge. PipeStore can be scaled and customised to suit any RES in any property. The technology can be positioned in a loft, between walls or in a garage etc. This means that buildings with space limitations can also benefit from RES.

The extreme pressures produce hoop stresses in a pipe causing the pipe welds to creep continuously in time until weld creep cracks are generated which, if undiscovered, may grow until the pipe ruptures. The pipes also suffer continuous cyclic loading through vibrations which produces fatigue cracks in the welds which if undetected are another cause of pipe rupture. Worldwide, failure to detect steam superheated steam pipe cracks results in a catastrophic failure every year or two with loss of life, appalling injuries, widespread power cuts and massive financial losses for the operators, typically with a cost impact of €120m per event. The project goal seeks to overcome the serious problems of superheated steamline integrity through the use of a high frequency long range ultrasonic condition monitoring system, permanently installed on pipe work, which will continuously inspect all welds in a plant during the entire plant design life whilst in service at 580oC (HotScan). Once installed at an outage there will be no need to remove lagging and perform inspection at subsequent outages, thus reducing planned outage time by 5% with a total saving €162 Million per annum (nuclear sector and €374 Million per annum (fossil fuel sector) if the HotScan system was deployed throughout the entire stock of EU power plant. The system will identify all creep and fatigue cracks of length greater than 1% of the pipe circumference, reducing the weld failure probability to below, eliminating forced outage time due to weld failure.

During the solar cycle, the Sun goes from quiet conditions at minimum to levels of high activity at maximum, where energetic phenomena, particularly coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, are common. These are accompanied by explosive release of mass, magnetic flux and energetic particles which may have damaging effects on satellites and on-board detectors. In extreme cases the effects may even be observed on ground-based systems (e.g., pipelines, power-grids). Returning humans to the Moon with the next possible stop Mars will mean ensuring the safety of the astronauts from these extreme conditions of space, especially the energetic particle environments. This includes particularly the sporadic SEP events that can disrupt the normal functioning of human cells. In this project data analysis and modeling will feed into the development of forecasting tools for both geomagnetic storms and SEPs. The tools will be incorporated into an automated operational European Space Weather Alert system. By analysis of historical data, complemented by the extensive data coverage of solar cycle 23, the key ingredients that lead to magnetic storm and SEP events and the factors that are responsible for false alarms will be identified. To enhance our understanding of the 3D kinematics and interplanetary propagation of CMEs, the structure, propagation and evolution of CMEs will be investigated.

While the statistics show some positive signs, the overall picture still shows sharp and sometimes rising inequalities, a loss of social cohesion and failing policies of integration.\n\nBut, contrary to what is sometimes thought, a lack of bottom-up innovation is not the issue in itself. European cities are teeming with new ideas, initiated by citizens, professionals and policymakers. The problem is, rather, that innovations taking place in the city are not effectively disseminated because they are not sufficiently understood. Many innovations are not picked up, because their relevance is not recognised or they fail after they have been introduced, because they were not suitable to the different conditions in another city in another country.\n\nIn this project, we will look into this missing link between innovations at the local level and their successful transfer and implementation to other settings. We will examine innovation in cities, not as a disconnected phenomenon, but as an element in a tradition of welfare that is part of particular socio-economic models and the result of specific national and local cultures. By contextualising innovations in local welfare, will be more effective in understanding how they could work in other cities, for the benefit of other citizens.\n\nIn short, the aim of the project is to examine, through cross-national comparative research, how local welfare systems affect social inequalities and how they favour social cohesion and sustainability.

Also, targeting the immune system towards cancer is a promising therapy to fight this disease. Cellular immunity mediated by memory CD8 T-cells provides vital protection against infections and the development of tumors. Understanding the formation and maintenance of these cells is therefore an essential step towards using these cells in a therapeutic way.\nMaintenance of T-cells must balance the need of their protective responses with the cost of sustaining specialized cells which may never again in life be required. The mechanisms controlling this balance are largely unknown. NKG2D is expressed on effector and memory T-cells and binds ligands which are upregulated in infected and oncogenic cells. NKG2D signaling promotes survival of lymphocytes via activation of the PI3K-signaling pathway. NK cells deficient for NKG2D undergo apoptosis more rapidly, showing its function in mediating viability and suggesting a role in memory T-cell maintenance. The T-cell receptor (TCR) has also been shown to be important for T-cell survival. TCR deficiency leads to a higher turn-over of memory T-cells. The pro-survival signaling cascade engaged by the TCR is unknown, but recent insights in tonic B-cell receptor signaling suggest involvement of the PI3K pathway.\nThis research project will investigate the role of NKG2D, the TCR and their intracellular signaling in memory T-cell biology. We will conduct our studies on a molecular, cellular and physiological level, using unique mouse models and advanced immunological techniques.

In fact, aircraft cabin noise during cruise is dominated by the TBL noise components. The noise is generated by the airflow over the fuselage surface and transmitted to the vehicle interior especially through vibration and sound radiation of panels of the aircraft fuselage. This problem is traditionally solved passively, by applying sound absorbing materials onto the panels. However, the low-frequency effectiveness of passive treatments is not sufficient. For this reason an interest has grown in using active noise transmission control. It can be implemented through smart panels with embedded sensor-actuator pairs which apply decentralised velocity feedback control. Such control generates active damping and thus significantly decreases the sound transmission at low frequencies, where it is dominated by resonances of fuselage panels. The major challenge in development of smart panels with decentralised velocity feedback control loops is the stability of practical systems, which limits the maximum feedback gain, and thus the maximum performance. Furthermore, due to the cross-talk between the control units, the increase in the number of feedback loops does not necessarily lead to the increase in global performance, as the maximum stable gain tends to decrease. In that case, there is a danger that unnecessary mass is added to the structure. Therefore the three objectives of the project SPRiNT are: to improve on the stability of the feedback loops, to investigate ways to reduce mass added to the structure by the active control system components, and finally, to optimize the number of control units per smart panel area.

Cloud computing is abstracting traditional reliance on locally available hardware and its configuration into the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) paradigms. In order to realize widespread adoption of cloud computing, consistent (ideally, well-defined) Quality of Service (QoS) needs to be delivered to the end users. Mandated by the cloud providers’ revenue model, cloud customers have to deal with the issue of multitenancy: placing of multiple individual customers on the same compute node. This results in variable performance of jobs executed on the cloud and thus unsatisfactory QoS. There is a need to enable a user to simply and quickly capture, compare, and monitor performance of their jobs within and across cloud computing providers. Extend Application Information Services (AIS) framework to allow individual services to run completely on cloud computing resources. Project will make AIS fully deployable on existing cloud frameworks. Provide a ready-to-deploy AIS distribution. AIS can be integrated into an otherwise existing cloud deployment as a standalone set of services independent of any other machine image or application instance. Perform a runtime analysis of a range of bioinformatics applications from different application categories to validate functionality delivered by AIS. Provide a complete application runtime performance data collection and retrieval solution for cloud computing. The solution easy to deploy, configure, and use by tools and individual users.

Advances in a range of sensing technologies and information processing have built up a potential for implementing new monitoring techniques that deliver key information for road management. The traditional monitoring techniques suffer for example in cost efficiency, time and spatial coverage, extent of traffic disruptions, indicator reliability, interpretation of physical processes, reflection of needs regarding functionality and safety, versatility and multi-purpose usage, etc. Due to these deficiencies, road management lacks widespread objective materials and condition data and hence be an effective and proactive tool for the improvement of physical and wider economic performance of the road network. Means of feedback of data into road management systems for future decision making should be integrated. Barriers to implementation of new monitoring techniques range from insufficient knowledge on actual measurements to ways of utilising information in decision making on strategic, network or object levels, as well as costs.\n\nMethod\nThe overall idea is to map needs for monitoring data and develop means of cost-benefit analysis of monitoring techniques and utilisation in asset management (WP2). Then, identified key technologies for monitoring pavements and bridges are investigated to improve data processing, interpretation and indicators (WP3 and WP4).

This situation has proven to favour large embedded system development companies against SMEs, as the former have the resources and know-how to apply expensive Total Quality Management (TQM) methods and iterative quality/design/development cycles.\nMODUS will develop and validate a set of technical methodologies, as well an open and customisable toolset, advancing embedded systems quality, by enabling:\n- Model verification by guiding the selection of existing open-source model verification  engines and producing inputs to be fed into them.\n- Interfacing with standard platforms for HW/SW co-simulation.\n- Software performance-tuning optimisation through automated design transformation.\n- Customisable source-code generation towards respecting coding standards and conventions.\nThe project will provide methodologies and open interfaces for customising and extending the MODUS toolset for use with different (domain-specific) FDTs, modelling practises, programming languages, target platforms, etc.\nMODUS will also define appropriate business models, centred on the role of SME Associations, towards the effective exploitation of the project results.''', 1814132.00, 1318500.00, 'FP7-SME-2011', 'BSG-SME-AG', 'KENTRO KAINOTOMON TECHNOLOGION AE', 'EL', 'IKT MREZA UDRUZENJE;M3 SYSTEMS SARL;MILTECH HELLAS AE;DRUSTVO ZA INFORMACIONE SISTEME I RACUNARSKE MREZE INFORMACIONO DRUSTVO SRBIJE UDRUZENJE;BITGEAR WIRELESS DESIGN SERVICES DOO;HEALTHCARE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY;ENOSI MIHANIKON PLIROFORIKIS & EPIKINONION ELLADOS (Greek Association of Computer Engineers);DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET;TELETEL TECHNOLOGIA TILEPIKOINONION KAI PLIROFORIKIS ANONYMI EMPORIKI VIOMICHANIKI ETAIREIA;SEPROTRONIC GMBH;UDRUGA ZA PROMICANJE POSLOVNE INFORMATIKE BIT', 'RS;FR;EL;UK;DK;DE;HR', 966042401, 'SCI'),

The establishment of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks and installing Offshore Wind Farms (OWF) are important ways to achieve these goals. The protection and management of marine biodiversity has focused on placing MPAs in areas important for biodiversity. This has proved successful within the MPAs, but had little impact beyond their boundaries. In the highly populated Mediterranean and the Black Seas, bordered by many range states, the declaration of extensive MPAs is unlikely at present, so limiting the bearing of protection. The establishment of MPAs networks can cope with this obstacle but, to be effective, such networks must be based on solid scientific knowledge and properly managed (not merely “paper parks”). OWF, meanwhile, must be placed where the winds are suitable for producing power, but they should not have any significant impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, or on human activities. The project will have two main themes:\n1 - identify prospective networks of existing or potential MPAs in the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, shifting from a local perspective (centred on single MPAs) to the regional level (network of MPAs) and finally the basin scale (network of networks). The identification of the physical and biological connections among MPAs will elucidate the patterns and processes of biodiversity distribution. Measures to improve protection schemes will be suggested, based on maintaining effective exchanges (biological and hydrological) between protected areas. The national coastal focus of existing MPAs will be widened to both off shore and deep sea habitats, incorporating them into the networks through examination of current legislation, to find legal solutions to set up transboundary MPAs.\n2 - explore where OWF might be established, producing an enriched wind atlas both for the Mediterranean and the Black Seas. OWF locations will avoid too sensitive habitats but the possibility for them to act as stepping-stones through MPAs, without interfering much with human activities, will be evaluated.\nSocioeconomic studies employing ecosystem services valuation methods to develop sustainable approaches for both MPA and OWF development will also be carried out, to complement the ecological and technological parts of the project, so as to provide guidelines to design, manage and monitor networks of MPAs and OWF.

This also applies to search and rescue missions, particularly in stormy conditions, where pilots need to risk their lives. These missions could be performed or facilitated by using autonomous helicopters with accurate positioning and the ability to land on mobile platforms such as ship decks. These applications strongly depend on the UAV reliability to react in a predictable and controllable manner in spite of perturbations, such as wind gusts.\\nOn the other hand, the cooperation, coordination and traffic control of many mobile entities are relevant issues for applications such as automation of industrial warehousing, surveillance by using aerial and ground vehicles, and transportation systems.\\nEC-SAFEMOBIL is devoted to the development of sufficiently accurate common motion estimation and control methods and technologies in order to reach levels of reliability and safety to facilitate unmanned vehicle deploymentin a broad range of applications. It also includes the development of a secure architecture and the middleware to support the implementation. Two different kinds of applications are included in the project:\\n\\n-\\tVery accurate coupled motion control of two mobile entities. The technologies will be demonstrated in two challenging applications dealing with the landing on mobile platforms and launching of unmanned aerial vehicles from a manned vehicle.\\n\\n-\\tDistributed safe reliable cooperation and coordination of many high mobility entities. The aim is to precisely control hundreds of entities efficiently and reliably and to certify developed techniques to support the exploitation of unmanned platforms in non-restricted areas. This development will be validated in two scenarios: industrial warehousing involving a large number of autonomous vehicles and surveillance also involving many mobile entities.\\n\\nThe new EC-SAFEMOBIL methods and the world first technology demonstrators will reinforce the position of the 5 academic and research institutions in the scientific constituency.

CI is a neuroprosthetic device that can evoke sensation of sound in deaf people by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, CI still produces very limited auditory sensations. Speech recognition in noise, multi-talker conversation, sound localization and music appreciation remain highly problematic for most of CI users. Current knowledge on auditory processing with CI is mostly based on studies with post-lingual CI users; these subjects used to have normal hearing, but had to adapt to electrical stimulation after they became deaf. It is not clear whether current problems in auditory processing by CI are due to the crude information provided by CI devices or because post-lingual subjects can not fully exploit all auditory information provided by CI devices. Therefore, our proposal aims at understanding auditory processing and its neural basis in specific subpopulation of young congenitally deaf subjects who received their cochlear implants within their first three years of life and have no normal hearing experience. In other words, we will collect and analyze data in subjects who developed their auditory system being exposed exclusively to electric stimulation. Our general hypothesis is that malleable brain plasticity during maturational phase, driven by solely electric stimulation, leads to enhanced use of available auditory CI cues and even to new forms of auditory processing. By comparing results of pre-lingual congenitally CI deaf users with those of post-lingually CI users, we will be able to disentangle neurobiological contributions from technological aspects of current CI devices to the auditory processing.

A modular approach is considered for skills practice through supporting individualisation in learning. This platform shall facilitate a novel development of universal approach in creative learning environment and knowledge management that encourage use of ICT. New learning model is challenging the education of engineers in embedded systems design through real-time experiments that stimulate curiosity with ultimate goal to support students to understand and construct their personal conceptual knowledge based on experiments. In addition to the technological approach, the use of cognitive theories on how people learn will help students to achieve a stronger and smarter adaptation of the subject.

Due to unique pattern of immune response, live attenuated CMVs are attractive candidates as vaccine vectors for a number of clinically relevant infections.

Now I propose to bring my research to a new level by tackling the problem of active and passive organisation of proteins into macromolecular structures on fluctuating fluid membranes, using a physicist’s approach across established disciplinary boundaries.\n\nThe formation and transport of supramolecular complexes in membranes is ubiquitous to nearly all functions of biological cells. Today, there is a variety of experiments suggesting that macromolecular complexes act as scaffolds for free proteins, overall yielding obstructed diffusion, counterbalanced by active transport by molecular motors. However, an integrative view connecting complexation and transport is largely missing. Furthermore, the effects of membrane mediated interactions and (non)-thermal fluctuations were so far overlooked. Gaining a quantitative insight into these processes is key to understanding the fundamental functioning of cells.\n\nTogether with my carefully selected team, I will address these intrinsically biological problems, by means of theoretical physics. Phenomena such as active and anomalous transport, as well as complexation are also currently subject to intense research in the statistical and soft matter physics communities. In this context, the aim of this proposal is to bridge the divide between the two worlds and significantly contribute to both physics and the life sciences by developing general principles that can be applied to processes in cells.

The steel demand in Europe in 2011 was estimated to be 145M tons, of which 39M tons p.a. for the construction sector and 16M tons p.a. for structural steel. Most of this steel is carbon or mild steel (as opposed to stainless steel) which corrodes at a high rate and although there are a significant number of anticorrosion solutions on the market, protective coating is most widely used, thanks to its low cost and high versatility. Often, an anticorrosion primer is applied just after manufacturing of steel in order to prevent rusting during storage and transportation before fabrication (cut,weld,drill,etc). Most anticorrosion primers last max 6 month due to poor quality or mechanical damage resulting in corrosion. Additionally, these anticorrosion primers are often too thick (~50μm) preventing weld quality, so time consuming localised grinding is done to remove the primer. If the primer is thin enough (~25μm) to allow welding, its anticorrosion properties are so limited, not reducing the risk of corrosion. Above all, the increased zinc content in the weldable primer formulation in order to achieve the anti-corrosion property result in health hazards and discomfort during fabrication process as it releases significant amount of zinc fumes. Alternatively, primers are simply not used at all but the expensive and hazardous blast cleaning of steel is carried out before fabrication which may sometimes be too late that it results in huge material waste and cost. The problem to be solved is the inability of the weldable primer produced today to allow both good quality welding and durable corrosion protection without health hazards.\nThe WeldaPrime project proposes an innovative approach for a zinc free corrosion protection primer with an optimum thickness and affordable cost, offering durable corrosion protection, resistant to mechanical damage and weldable without zinc fumes.''', 2715830.90, 2106000.00, 'FP7-SME-2013', 'BSG-SME-AG', 'EUROPEAN FEDERATION FOR WELDING JOINING AND CUTTING AISBL', 'BE', 'TALLERES DE SOLDADURA Y MECANIZADO;LOUFAKIS CHEMICALS SA;THOMAS SWAN & CO LIMITED;"L''UREDERRA, FUNDACION PARA EL DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO Y SOCIAL";CROATIAN CHAMBER OF ECONOMY CCE;LEIBNIZ-INSTITUT FUER NEUE MATERIALIEN GEMEINNUETZIGE GMBH;THE BRITISH COATINGS FEDERATION LIMITED LBG;TWI LIMITED;FEDERACION VIZCAINA DE EMPRESAS DEL METAL', 'ES;EL;UK;HR;DE', 997334213, 'REG'),

The large contaminated sites will be covered by 100%, presented by fine scale 3D maps of contaminant levels and giving quality and quantity data for the pollutants (heavy metals, organic solvents, NAPLS) without the need of human intervention. Considering that the personnel is endangered by the toxic contaminants, this is very important.\n\nFour different types of sensors (HPU, GPR, chemical sensors and SAW) will be integrated to detect efficiently the contaminants in the surface and underground (up to 10 meters). Data collected from the sensors will be fused, correlated and optimized to provide GPS linked ground 3D images of contaminant distribution. Thus ground property images from different sensors can be combined to produce composite images that can be used also later to during the treatment of soil contamination.

Although intensively studied, many fundamental aspects of the HSV-1 biology are poorly understood, including the control of latency and regulation of gene expression. We have recently discovered numerous miRNAs, a class of small regulatory non-coding RNAs, expressed by HSV-1 and closely related virus, HSV-2, revealing a new paradigm for the HSV gene regulation. Some of these miRNAs are conserved between these two viruses and expressed differentially during different phases of infection; however function of most HSV miRNAs is unknown. We hypothesize that miRNAs have a central role in modulating the host-pathogen interaction that leads to efficient virus replication and establishment of latency. Also, we hypothesize that miRNA have a central role in establishing the threshold for the reactivation upon different stimuli, i.e. control of the lytic-latent switch. Here we seek to understand the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs), encoded by the virus and host, in the regulation of gene expression during lytic and latent HSV-1 infection. We primarily focus on functions of miR-H1 and miR-H6, HSV-1 miRNAs abundantly expressed during lytic infection, and lytic and latent infection, respectively, and miRNAs almost entirely complementary to each other. In our preliminary data, we have generated the HSV-1 mutant impaired for the expression of these miRNAs and characterize the mutant in vitro and in a mouse model. In addition, to enable high-throughput technologies, we have tested several in vitro latency models and characterized the expression of HSV-1 and host miRNAs in these models.

Ab is released from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) during specialised processing events. This proposal aims to examine presenilin 2 (PS2) protein-mediated molecular and cellular events that are protective against Ab accumulation and AD and, as such, is aligned with the objective of the FP7’s Health Research Programme that focuses on “Research on the brain and related diseases”. We propose that cerebellum, an area of the human brain that is inherently resistant to AD, holds the key regulator(s) against AD. Indeed, we have recently shown that mature APP is significantly reduced in human cerebellum compared to entorhinal cortex and hippocampus - the most susceptible human brain regions to AD. Our further preliminary results have shown that PS2 protein is significantly overexpressed in cerebellum compared to other brain regions. We hypothesise that PS2 overexpression in cerebellum is, at least in part, responsible for reduced APP maturation leading to reduced Ab generation and protection against AD. We will examine a protective role of PS2 against AD in a multidisciplinary project performing molecular and cell biological as well as proteomic analyses in vitro (at a cellular level) and in vivo (in an animal model of AD) as well as in human brain samples. We will also test whether PS2 alterations contribute to AD-like phenotype in a rare lysosomal disorder Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD) in which cerebellum is the most affected brain region and whether PS2 contributes to APP-CTF/Ab degradation and Ab reduction through its role in autophagy-lysosomal system. These studies will reveal a novel role for PS2 in APP and Ab metabolism and its function as a brain protector. Our understanding of the protective mechanisms in the human brain will pave the way for development of adequate therapies against AD and NPCD.''', 192338.00, 192338.00, 'FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IEF', 'MC-IEF', 'RUDER BOSKOVIC INSTITUTE', 'HR', '999875031', NULL, NULL, NULL);

In use of subjective data the crucial question is how much confidence one can have in truthfulness of respondents'' answers. Resolving this problem would improve reliability of current uses of subjective data and also open up new possibilities of use. One solution to this problem is presented by Bayesian Truth serum (BTS). BTS is a game-theoretic scoring system that takes as inputs respondents’ answers to questions, as well as their probabilistic predictions about the distribution of answers in the sample. It induces truthful answers from a sample of rational, i.e. Bayesian, expected value maximizing respondents. The method allows for collecting data on issues that are not common knowledge of neither respondents nor experimenters. In particular, BTS can be applied to judgments involving counter-factual or conditional scenarios, such as arise naturally in policy discussions. BTS is a very new methodology that is currently being experimentally validated through a large scale project IARPA RFI-10-01 at MIT, starting from 2011. The BTS method offers various opportunities for application to economic and social sciences. This project proposes to apply the BTS method to innovation research by making adaptations to the BTS so it can be embedded in the conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis is a methodology widely used across industries and in public sector for preference elicitation related to new products, services or policies. Conjoint analysis allows for designing products/services/policies with the ideal combination of features thus increasing probability of successful introduction. As all methods that use primary data collected through surveys, conjoint analysis crucially depends on the truthfulness of the subjective data.

How to describe and understand such a remarkable process? What is its effect on pathological developments?

The central question in the field is how accurate chromosome segregation results from the interactions between kinetochores, microtubules and the associated proteins. According to the current paradigm, the forces on kinetochores are produced by k-fibers, bundles of microtubules extending between the spindle pole and the kinetochore. The proposed project is built upon a groundbreaking hypothesis that a new class of microtubules, which we term bridging microtubules, bridge sister kinetochores. Our preliminary results show that bridging microtubules are responsible for the positioning of kinetochores in HeLa and PtK1 cells. Bridging microtubules have not been studied before because this requires cutting-edge microscopy and laser microsurgery techniques. By applying these methods, with which I have extensive expertise, we will determine the organization of these microtubules, identify the proteins that link them with k-fibers, and uncover where and how the forces for kinetochore positioning and movement are generated. My strength is in taking an interdisciplinary approach, which I will use in this project by combining laser microsurgery with genetic perturbations, quantitative measurements of the responses and comparison with theoretical models. Understanding the role of bridging microtubules in force generation and chromosome movements will not only shed light on the mechanism of chromosome segregation, but may also increase the potential of mitotic anticancer strategies, as the spindle is a major target for chemotherapy.

If arrhythmias are detected at an early stage of heart disease, appropriate treatment can be effective, reducing disability and death. However, in the early stages of disease these may be transient, lasting only a few seconds, and thus difficult to detect.

Thus, faster diagnostic techniques are necessary to ensure an immediate and targeted treatment of the patient. DNA-based diagnostics can provide the relevant results within a few hours.\nThe requirements for a clinical DNA-based characterisation method are high; more than 1000 clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, a few hundred phylogenetic marker genes and virulence factors have to be targeted (including SNP detection).

It will enable numerous physicians to acquire the trunk surface (TS). TS symmetry is one of the key elements in diagnostic and evaluation of various treatments in patients with trunk deformities. Common radiographic evaluation methods are known to expose patients to a radiation and, besides, radiography is actually 2D representation of 3D problem which has been shown not to be directly related to the shape of the back. Thus, there has been a constant motivation among researchers at (inter)national level to develop an optimal methodology for 3D reconstruction of the back. Still, most of those developed systems are mainly directed to 3D reconstruction of the spine and calculation of the Cobb angle which is still regarded by many as the gold standard method to measure scoliotic deformity. Still, the Cobb angle alone cannot explain the whole of the surface deformity. Evidently, there is high need to investigate development of a 3D reconstruction system which will capture both back and front of the patient, i.e. the entire trunk surface. In turn it would enable a more thorough analysis of the patient’s deformity pattern, i.e. a second major goal during this project is to derive other parameters (not only Cobb angle) in order to quantify trunk deformities. In designing 3D system we underline that we plan to research the implementation of both passive and active stereovision strategies. Researching the implementation of combined best features from passive and active stereo for one concrete of 3D system aimed at TS reconstruction (scoliosis), would be a great contribution for potential other 3D applications.

NK cells are essential in early control of CMV infection. An evolutionary struggle between NK cells and CMVs can be inferred from a numerous viral mechanisms designed to compromise NK cell function. A deeper insight was gained by studying MCMV evasion of ‘missing-self’ mechanisms and host response to this immunoevasion, illustrated by several MCMV-specific NK cell activating receptors. The work on Ly49H receptor emphasized the selective pressure imposed on the virus to generate variants no longer recognized by this receptor. Another example can be seen from the function of viral m04 protein, which binds to newly synthesized MHC-I molecules and escorts them to the cell surface to engage inhibitory Ly49 receptors. However, while m04 prevents NK cell activation by escaping ‘missing-self’ recognition, several activating Ly49 receptors also depend on its presence for their own recognition of infected cells. Beside m04, another so far unidentified viral factor is required for turning on the activating Ly49 receptors. In addition to characterization of this new viral gene, the aim of this study is to elucidate the functional significance of MCMV-specific activating Ly49 receptors and their interaction with inhibitory counterparts during primary and latent infection. Ly49 receptors in mice are functional homologues of KIR receptors in humans. Recent studies also indicate a strong impact of HCMV on the repertoire and frequency of activating KIR-expressing NK cells, suggesting their specific response to this virus. Therefore, in addition to the MCMV genes involved in ligation of activating Ly49 receptors, here we also propose study aimed to characterize HCMV gene(s) involved in ligation of activating KIRs. We expect these studies to provide new data of groundbreaking potential in the field.

The basic idea underlying the project stems from an apparent disparity between the rather advanced extensions of the traditional linear finite-element principles to non-linear problems and the fact that the key finite-element concept – that of interpolation of the unknown functions – is surprisingly kept mostly constant, i.e. configuration-independent. Enabling the finite-element approximation to become configuration-dependent is motivated by the existing need to improve the current non-linear finite-element procedures, in particular for mechanical problems defined on non-linear manifolds. This principle is presented as the general concept providing viable novel development paradigm with obvious benefits for a wider class of mechanical problems. The configuration-dependent approximation to be designed shall obey the essential convergence requirements, with its extra flexibility (arising from the potential of the new approximation to vary with the configuration) employed to improve the solution in some clearly defined manner. In particular, during the design process, the following two basic principles will be consistently adhered to: (i) In the limiting case where the non-linear mechanical problem becomes linear, the configuration-dependent approximation sought must coincide with a known reference interpolation for linear analysis. (ii) In a general non-linear situation, the configuration-dependent approximation should preserve a set of selected mechanical or mathematical properties of equilibrium or motion defined beforehand.

Presence of Mousterian artefacts at one of the sites, and Upper Paleolithic tool types at another suggests two populations (i.e. Neandertals and anatomically modern humans) were present in the region during the Late Pleistocene. Data from the proposed excavations may provide a basis to test some of the highly debated questions regarding the relation of biological population to behavioral aspects (e.g. whether Neandertals or anatomically modern humans were responsible for Early Upper Paleolithic, is there a sharp distinction in behavior and anatomy between these groups etc. Furthermore, at one site early Mesolithic is documented, while at another Late Mesolithic is present, allowing similar issues regarding behavior and other aspects to be tested, including issues related to the transition to Neolithic (agricultural) lifestyle. A comparison of data between all four sites could provide us with a basis for testing of issues related to changing life ways, land use, movement patterns, site use, biological aspects (similarities and differences), contact zones, mobility, continuity, etc. at times of changing climatic and environmental conditions and thus help us to understand this crucial time period, in particular, and how humans respond to such changes, in general.

Based on those results we plan to pursue the following investigations in the representation theory of p-adic groups. We would like to compute the Jacquet modules of discrete series representations completely.This will help us understand representations parabolically induced from those discrete series (generalized principal series) completely. This will have consequence on the problems of determination of complementary series for classical groups a problem related to the classification of unitary representations. Results of Gan, Savin and Ichino will help us extend some of those results to metaplectic groups. This will have important consequence on the determination of theta correspondence for dual pairs consisting of odd orthogonal and metaplectic groups such as explicit determination of all theta lifts. In the theory of automorphic forms, we would like to understand the construction of Arthur and Moeglin more explicitly.

In order to do that we have to study different forms of self-generating mechanisms by which the autonomous mind (AM) is brought about. The autonomous then stays roughly for the mental ''infrastructure'' that operates by generating impulses for action, mental and motor, without having to process them in consciousness. We will consider this phenomenon as primary in relation to consciousness that emerges rather late in the chain of mental processing. One of the basic premisses that builds the ground for our investigation is the assumption that mental states are heavily underdetermined by sensory data. To claim this is to enter the dispute with the current mainstream (particularly within the consciousness studies) that sees mental phenomena (specifically consciousness) firmly rooted in sensation, on the ne hand; it also means a conflict with the canon of intellectualism, the long-lasting impact of which (following Descartes) resulted in consciousness- and thought-centeredness with which we are faced and which we want to critically examine, on the other hand.

However, the effects of different enological procedures on biological activity of wine are poorly investigated. The overall aim of this project, which represents an interdisciplinary research effort of experts from fields of biotechnology and biomedicine, is to investigate how different enological procedures in wine making (changes of maceration time, partial/complete dealcoholization, aging of wine) may affect its biological activity. This also includes investigation of potential differences in distinctive biological effects between wines obtained by the technology of white and red wine production. In contrast to the process of red wine production, in the white wine production there is no maceration in contact with grape seeds and skins, and only fermentation of immediately separated grape juice occurs. So, biological potentials of white wines may considerably differ from that of red wines. Conversely, if even short maceration is allowed in the process of white wine making, polyphenolic content and antioxidant potential of such wines is significantly enhanced. There are several studies demonstrating superior effects of red versus white wine on certain cardiovascular parameters. However, epidemiological evidence demonstrating specific benefits of red over white wine is poor and conclusive studies comparing the two are missing. Detailed biochemical analyses of all test wines will be performed and their biochemical properties will be correlated with their biological activity. Among numerous biological effects of wine and its constituents, this project focuses on cardiovascular, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of wine that will be examined on a spectrum of in vitro and in vivo biological systems including small laboratory animals and human volunteers.

The most frequent form of AITD is Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) that is characterised by progressive destruction of thyroid tissue. Many studies tried to unravel genetic contribution to HT development in the past few decades but with low success. The breakthrough of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) tremendously increased the rate of detecting novel associations. However, HT has been unrepresented in the GWAS mostly because of the lack of large cohorts of HT patients and the performance of such study is a matter of urgency. We plan to recruit 500 HT patients and to create a DNA/serum/plasma biobank of deeply phenotyped HT patients that will serve as a powerful resource for current and future investigations. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants underlying HT by performing the first GWAS focusing on HT exclusively. We will use newly recruited HT patients and 500 existing controls (from the “10,000 Dalmatians” study) in case-control GWAS and validate observed associations in an independent replication cohort. To further help in elucidating genetic contribution to HT we will perform pathway analysis and gene-interaction analysis using variety of environmental factors and medical records that will be collected from HT patients. We will also perform deep phenotype characterisation of HT patients that may provide additional clues about HT aetiology. This is timely planned study that aims to generate new knowledge that will advance our understanding of the genetic basis and underlying biological mechanisms of HT. This knowledge will be crucial in guiding the development of new prevention, diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

Repeated drug taking leads to neuroadaptations which over time affect neural networks and change behavior. One such change induced by drugs and commonly studied in lab animals is behavioral sensitization. Regulation of gene expression is one important mechanism by which drugs change the plasticity of the networks which regulate behavior. A group of transcriptional regulators of the molecular circadian clock have been identified to function as regulators of behavioral sensitization to cocaine in Drosophila. Subsequent studies in rodents proved the universality of those genes in mediating drug responses. The genetic pathways and molecular interactions through which circadian genes regulate drug responses has remained undefined. We hypothesize that new genes which interact with circadian genes in the regulation of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants can be identified in a genetic screen in Drosophila. This is a goal for which Drosophila is perfectly suited, because genetic screens aimed at defining new genes can be performed relatively easy, fast and cheap. Our first aim is to devise a high-throughput method for measuring behavioral sensitization in flies by modifying the existing method for measuring activity. Second, we will undertake a directed behavioral screen by pre-selecting candidates with reported molecular interaction with circadian genes. In the third aim we will use transgenic flies and other genetic tools to investigate neural mechanisms involved in behavioral sensitization. The proposed research is innovative and relevant for human health. New gene candidates isolated in this screen could easily be translated into mammalian research where they will help in further understanding of neuroplastic changes induced by psychostimulants.

Understanding dynamic traffic scenes is especially interesting due to exciting applications in the fields of smart vehicles (driver assistance, autonomous cars) and intelligent transportation systems (road safety inspection, adaptive traffic control). Nevertheless, many of these applications are out of reach since the computers are still unable to match human perception. We believe that this gap would be reduced by improving our understanding of scalable detection of multiple object classes in dynamic scenes. The task of object detection is to localize objects of interest in input images. We address detection in the most general case where the objects of interest exhibit large appearance variation. In this case the problem is often referred to as multi-class object detection. Our proposal focuses on dynamic traffic scenes acquired by a calibrated stereo rig from the driver''s perspective. We propose to develop detection approaches which would combine estimated camera motion and scene structure with learned appearance features, and to experimentally compare them with the state of the art. We shall employ advanced methodologies such as SfM, dense stereo, variational optimization, scene flow, spatio-temporal descriptors, latent SVM and Fisher vectors. These methodologies shall enable us to achieve improvements upon the state of the art in terms of scalability and detection performance. This will open way to exciting applications capable of reducing traffic accidents, improving efficiency and decreasing traffic congestion. Some of these applications shall be demonstrated by experiments on a real autonomous car.

The goal of the project is the development of a robot-based diagnostic protocol and testing of its verification in clinical settings. The robots will be used as ASD co-evaluators to help a human evaluator to assess the child behavior objectively.

The robots will have two functions: observation and quantitative measurement of child’s social responses; and performance of standardized social presses designed to provoke child response. This involves actions such as analyses of the audio signal and differentiation of vocalizations and speech, detection of eye-gaze direction, performance of different actions and gestures and utilization of human-robot and robot-robot interaction to attract child attention.

Our interest is in plasmas produced in vacuum, under low-pressure gas environment, at atmospheric air or on/within liquids. Discharges which we use range from electrodeless, single electrode to various designs of two electrode systems. Lasers we use are cw or pulsed nanosecond. In our research special care will be devoted to tailoring the electron energy distribution functions as a key factor influencing plasma content and features.

In this project we shall combine laser produced plasmas with discharge plasmas to achieve that goal. To understand the complex nature of plasma or processes of plasma interaction with other matter phases (gases, liquids and solids) basic approach is to perform plasma diagnostics by various types of optical and laser spectroscopies. To interpret findings we study basic atomic collision processes in plasmas and structure and spectra of various complexes formed within plasma (dimers, radicals etc). Modeling of various processes within cold plasmas and laser produced plasmas is performed in addition.

The first Diophantine quadruple {1,3,8,120} was found by Fermat. Baker and Davenport proved that Fermat''s set cannot be extended to a quintuple. This result motivated the famous conjecture that there does not exist a Diophantine quintuple.

Recently, Filipin, Fujita and Elsholtz significantly improved previously known upper bounds for the number of Diophantine quintuples, but the main conjecture still remains open. Various generalizations of Diophantine m-tuples will be studied, in particular, considering the problem in the rings of integers of number fields of small degree.

Reliable ship speed loss estimation under real environmental conditions allows a more accurate prediction of the power increase and fuel consumption as well as gas emissions from ships. Nowadays this second issue becomes very important because of the problem of global warming. Following the increasing awareness of the environmental and human health concerns of shipping, legislative actions have been taken on global and national levels making mandatory (from January 1st 2013) that new ships over 400 gross tonnage, to comply with the regulations, should have emissions of CO2 under limiting value. Technological enhancement to ships like improved hull designs as well as improvement in power and propulsion systems could potentially reduce CO2 emission up to 35 %. These measures could effectively be combined with several other operational measures, such as weather routing and voyage planning, in order to ensure that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from ships are minimized on every voyage. The proposed research will be conducted in three main areas: 1. Improvement of the methodology of ship speed, fuel consumption and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (especially CO2) calculation on actual weather conditions, 2. Optimization of the ship hull (bow and stern) and ship propulsion system operating in actual weather condition, 3. Optimization of ship route by taking into account all relevant parameters: weather prediction, attainable ship speed on waves, main engine performance and navigation constrains. The objective is to improve ship design and performance taking into accounts the environmental issue, creating a so called eco-efficient or “green” ship design.

We focus specifically on bond markets in all EU member states and the US, and differentiate seven research segments that are mutually interrelated. First segment applies GARCH-type models and estimates sovereign bond spread volatility and the volatility risk premium. The output of this segment is used in subsequent segments; in the model of spread determinants, volatility spillovers, and capital flight. Second segment is dedicated to the analysis of the statistical properties of sovereign spreads volatility by an application of extreme value theory, self-exciting and Markov switching models. We quantify extremal dependence between spreads and the distribution of clusters of their extreme movements using the extremogram. Two segments are devoted to the analysis of volatility spillovers across bond markets and time-varying degree of sovereign bond market integration in developed and emerging EU countries. We also analyze political factors that may influence the sovereign bond market and cross-border capital movement. In this segment we code political variables employed as explanatory variables in the remaining two segments. Hence segment six estimates the model of spread determinants that includes a more balanced and detailed representation of market sentiment and volatility, fiscal features, and political factors. Due to the fact that in recent times extreme changes in sovereign bond markets induced cross-border reallocation of the capital, in the seventh segment we estimate a capital flight model that includes political factors and sovereign spread volatility premium.

Several studies have shown that infratentorial lesions are related to conversion rate and long-term prognosis for patients with CIS and thus may help to identify patients at high risk for earlier occurrence of clinically relevant disability. Bearing in mind the poor correlation between clinical symptoms and MRI findings there is a need for ancillary tools in the evaluation of brainstem pathology in MS. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of the brainstem evoked potentials score (bilateral AEP, bilateral ocular and cervical VEMP and bilateral tongue SSEP), the modified evoked potentials score (combination of brainstem evoked potentials score and VEP and SSEP of the median and tibial nerve) and standardized autonomic nervous system testing (Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS)) in the prediction of conversion from CIS to MS and accumulation of future disability. After 24 months of follow-up, this study could reveal the prognostic value of the brainstem EP score, modified EP score and CASS in patients with CIS on a number of parameters including: time until second relapse, accumulation of disability, accumulation of MRI lesions in the first 6 months, time to conversion from CIS to MS according to the 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria, number of relapses in the first 2 years of follow up. It can be presumed that the brainstem EP score and CASS score as direct and indirect measures of brainstem dysfunction, respectively will prove as reliable markers of future disability of CIS and MS patients.

A prerequisite for this progress is the complete understanding of the Standard model (SM) predictions. One of the triumphs of SM physics has been the extent to which QCD successfully describes strong interaction processes observed at colliders. More accurate QCD calculations are nowadays essential in understanding the enormous amount of available high-precision data, particularly since new physics effects are obscured by standard QCD processes. Our focus in that area will be to improve the description of hard exclusive processes by including higher-order contributions and by further developing the corresponding methods for automatic QCD calculations. Furthermore, we plan to do precision studies of top-quark production and decay observables which provide a unique view to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, important for understanding of particle mass generation. In the top-quark decay the information about its spin polarization imprinted by the production process is preserved, and can be calculated and measured in angular distributions of decay products providing other way to search for deviations from the SM expectations. Regarding new physics, the fact that neutrinos have a mass already requires an extension of the SM and calls for an understanding of the origin of neutrino masses. The seesaw mechanism, included in a theory as the one where left-right symmetry (parity) is restored at accessible LHC energies, stands out as a prominent theoretical candidate, and this theory links the origin of neutrino masses to new interactions at high energies and to the restoration of parity. A phenomenological investigation of these predictions is thus compelling and timely.

While passive approach to their integration might cause problems to the system, active utilization of their flexibility might enable higher penetration of RES. A similar reasoning can be applied to the distributed generation, especially technologies with the potential of multi energy vector interaction (efficient electric heating, combined heat and power, battery storage etc.). Current grids need to be capable of dealing with mentioned requirements. The concept of Smart Grid (SG) is based on using of novel information and communication technology (ICT) and includes application of a spectrum of innovative and flexible technologies. The purpose of this project is to establish a methodological and comprehensive framework providing the costs and benefits evaluation of SG projects and technologies. Given the sizeable investments needed, there is a need for a fair, consistent and methodological approach for estimation of the best investment option, taking into account economic and environmental aspects of a specific project.

However, the increased mineral content in the diet does not guarantee increased mineral status for consumers and consequently mineral malnutrition is one of the global health concerns. Phytic acid (PA) acts as antinutritive compound by binding mineral cations and forming mixed salts. PA is also the main storage molecule for phosphorus and it is essential for normal seed development and germination. Seed mineral and PA content varies widely among bean genotypes. In Croatia bean is traditionally grown in low input production systems. The production is based on landraces which are adapted to local environments and display high levels of morphological diversity. A broad variability is also expected in seed bioactive nutrient content as well as on genetic level. Through international collaboration on Phaseolus genomics, a lot of information has become available including genetic linkage maps, microsatellite databases and a massive number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sequences. In proposed project an integrated approach will be used to characterize bioactive nutrient variability and the inherent genetic diversity. In conjunction with a detailed data on bioactive nutrient content, a whole genome association mapping analysis will be carried out in order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to bioactive nutrient content. Success in bean breeding for higher quality relies on the availability of information on bioactive nutrient content and the knowledge of genetic bases of quality trait variability.

Studies on the rare inherited forms of PD caused by mutations in the aSyn gene have highlighted disturbed aSyn clearance through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) as a key mechanism leading to PD/LBD. Furthermore, several rare inherited disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal genes show parkinsonian-like phenotype and accumulation of aSyn, providing additional evidence for the role of lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies.

These ubiquitous pathogens are among the most common causatives of respiratory tract infections and are responsible for a high degree of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Because of the error-prone nature of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and large population sizes, RNA viruses show high levels of genetic diversity.

The qualifying aim of this project is to explore the idea that CP violation may be traced back to gravity.

The focus will be in particular on the natural candidates for parity violating gravity processes - the Chern-Simons terms, both pure gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational ones - using extra-dimension models inspired by the string theory.

HCV productively infects hepatocytes to impart liver inflammation and progressive tissue damage leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. These processes underlie liver dysfunction and are thought to drive the onset of liver cancer. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which HCV confers hepatic inflammation are not defined. Now, there is growing evidence that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and Kupffer cells (KC), may play key roles in regulating immune responses and facilitating tolerance induction. These cells are playing a pivotal role in blood-borne virus clearance (&gt;90%), leaving only a small fraction of infectious virus that escapes clearance in a manner peculiar to each individual pathogen. The biology of HCV, specifically regarding non-parenchymal liver cells, has been largely neglected. LSEC account for the 20% and KC for 15% of the hepatic cells, and are a unique organ-resident cell population with diverse functions, including degradation of bacterial by-products, antigen presentation and induction of tolerance. The hypothesis of the research is that HCV infection reprograms cellular gene expression of LSEC and KC, which results in the modulation of the inflammatory responses. Applying the infectomics approach, we plan to perform a series of next-generation sequencing experiments on LSEC and KC isolated and purified from healthy, mild and severe chronic hepatitis C liver biopsies. This will allow us to detect expression changes related with disease progression. Selected candidate genes will be comprehensively studied in in vitro systems in order to elucidate their role in modulation of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. Through the development of this project it is expected that a series of high impact results will be obtained, which will facilitate the development of more significant biomarkers and effective interventions against HCV infection.

Therefore, our goal is to establish reliable avenues for the design of crystalline metal-containing materials by encoding building-blocks with structural-preferences that lead to ‘programmable’ assembly, thus avoiding serendipity and chance when targeting new materials with specific and tunable properties. To achieve this, we first need to map out the structural landscape that controls how metal complexes communicate and subsequently assemble into 3-D architectures. We will explore and quantify the interrelationship between ligand-field splitting energy, coordination geometry, metal-ligand dimensionality, ligand flexibility, and supramolecular assembly, one variable at a time, using a combination of experiment and theory. This will enable us to map out the structural landscape defined by metal(II) complexes (Co, Ni, Cu and Cd) and custom-made ligands decorated with functionalities that are known to form reliable supramolecular synthons in organic solids. New structural and spectroscopic information will be complemented by data obtained by mining the CSD, while computational methods will inform both the planning as well as the interpretation of the experimental efforts.

Unlike most of the other mutated proteins known to cause ALS by their toxic prion-like properties, optineurin is largely thought to cause disease by loss-of-function, arguing for its protective role. In vitro studies proposed that it regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell signaling, autophagy and vesicle trafficking, but their link to neurodegeneration is unknown. ALS is not an autonomous disease of selected neurons. Glial cells including microglia, are essential for neuroinflammation, which greatly shapes disease progression. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the exact role(s) whereby optineurin exerts neuroprotection, pinpoint the cell types in which it acts, and determine its putative effect(s) on the interactions between the cell types relevant for neurodegeneration. We aim to dissect these questions in a stepwise fashion by (1) assessing cell-intrinsic functions in neurons, microglia and macrophages, (2) addressing crosstalk in mix-and-match co-cultures and organotypic spinal cord slices, and (3) verifying these findings in mice. To this end, we have generated a novel disease-mimicking genetic mouse model of optineurin insufficiency. Analyzing the function of optineurin in primary cells and mice models is crucial to the success of this study, given that ubiquitin-binding proteins are prone to in vitro artifacts. Incomplete understanding of ALS pathogenesis is directly mirrored in almost complete inability to treat ALS patients: a single approved drug exerts only a small prolongation in survival. Here, we propose to study a unique ALS model, set apart from the currently available models of direct toxicity by its ability to provide insight into basic neuroprotective mechanisms, thus expectedly paving the way for more successful therapies.

The geopolitical strategy of Rome in conquered regions was to encourage the integration process, where the Roman army gave its contribution. Archaeological data testify that the indigenous communities of Illyricum reacted differently to this process. Some were willing to accept the Roman heritage (e.g. Liburnians), while the others (e.g. Delmatae) were providing resistance. Given previous research today we have a number of valuable studies about certain aspects of Roman domination. However, they are primarily focused either on the ancient written sources or the archaeological material from Dalmatia and Pannonia. This research of the integration would cover for the first time the Roman military presence on the area of Croatia. The main focus is on the Roman military sites along the Dalmataean and the the Danube limes. New data will be derived using the methodology purposely created for this project and includes archaeological survey, classification, comparison and evaluation of all available data both archaeological and ancient sources with the application of the variable of geographic origin. Such research has never been undertaken in Croatia. The results would fill the informational gaps that exist for this part of the Empire through the analysis of the largest possible amount of information about the Roman army activities and the integration of indigenous people.

The decrease in the processing speed influences language processes that require fast execution or simultaneity. This results in a typical pattern of changes, different from the ones in clinical populations. Therefore, executive functions in these groups will be studied in order to build a comprehensive model of adult language processing. Theories of language processing (namely, Role and Reference Grammar - RRG) will be considered to define specific traces of language processing that assume fast execution or simultaneity and therefore should be the most vulnerable in aging population. These traces will be defined and described which will put Croatian into a cross-linguistic perspective in contemporary studies of linguistic aphasiology and provide coherent picture of age related changes in adult language system.

Therefore, the quest for a self-consistent theory applicable for description of systems with lattice disorder is a fundamental issue. Despite the efforts put into investigation of vibrational excitations in disordered systems at low temperatures, the consensus about their physical origin is still lacking. This project aims to address the subject by fully exploiting the advantage of embedded paramagnetic centres through focusing on their relaxation behaviour, which bears the information about the local frustration of the environment. The energy exchange within the spin system and between the spin system and the lattice will be detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) as a function of disorder in the vicinity of the paramagnetic centre. This we can control by preparing the host matrix in the glassy, supercooled or crystalline state. We propose to investigate the specific molecular dynamics due to the presence of disorder in the system while switching the very same compound doped with paramagnetic centres from disordered to more ordered state, such as from glassy to crystalline state. Additionally, the microscopic picture of local disordered sites will be examined in other systems doped with paramagnetic centres such as various polymer matrices or hydrogen-bonded crystals. The origin of local disorder will be correlated with the influence of different numbers of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of paramagnetic site as well as with the degree of local spin frustration. We expect that this comparative study will enlighten the peculiarities of vibrational density of states of amorphous materials and contribute towards development of the unique model of low-temperature molecular dynamics of disordered systems in general.

Several forms are classified in clinical practice, depending on the main pathogenic mechanism: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used mouse model of RA and is still an indispensible tool to study the disease pathogenesis. Through the production of osteoresorptive mediators by immune cells, chronic inflammation in arthritis creates a microenvironment that promotes osteoresorption by osteoclasts (OC). OCs are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells arising from myeloid hematopoietic lineage. A number of systemic and local stimuli, such as hormones and cytokines/chemokines, promote osteoclastogenesis by enhancing OC differentiation, migration, activation, lifespan and function, but the exact mechanisms of how the inflammatory network works in vivo in the context of arthritis are largely unclear. Particularly, the human osteoclast progenitor (OCP) populations are not precisely defined and it is, as yet, unknown which critical mediators have the potential to activate OCPs and attract them to produce joint lesions. Using the mouse model of CIA and samples from arthritic patients we propose to elucidate differentiation sequence of early progenitors into mature OCs, shifts in the frequency of discrete OCP subpopulations and their migration patterns during arthritis. We plan to identify distinct OCP subpopulations in the bone marrow, periphery and joint lesions, their migratory and homing patterns, and their functional links to bone loss in arthritis. We expect to define the properties of inflammatory microenvironment in the regulation of OC trafficking, differentiation and activity in arthritis. A better characterization of arthritis-induced OCP subpopulations could offer the potential to design therapeutic approaches to control their migration and curtail their osteoresorptive potential.

The core methodology consists in conducting philosophical investigations that are aimed at offering practical recommendations and that are constrained by knowledge of the practical setting of Croatian mental health law and care. Two central philosophical issues appear to be relevant to the philosophical investigation and, thus, addressing them is the aim of the project. First, a significant part of the contemporary debate on the social response to antisocial personality disorder centers on this notion. Some have argued that this notion involves normative preconceptions against the liberties of certain individuals. Others have questioned the accuracy and scientific robustness of the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorders and its precision of related risk predictions. Second, the justification for choosing the appropriate treatment for people with antisocial personality disorder must also be a moral one. In particular, a relevant type of moral justification has to be grounded in principles that correlate psychological descriptions and explanations of a person’s behavior with his or her degree of responsibility. Similarly, compulsory treatment appears to be conditional upon a person’s diminished responsibility or capacity to act accordingly to a treatment decision, together with the existence of a risk to themselves or to others. The philosophical investigation of the project will be integrated with the contributions of a leading forensic psychiatrist in Croatia, a sociological qualitative analysis of the practices and challenges that are encountered by institutional representatives in the forensic department of the Rab psychiatric hospital and an historical investigation of the institutional response to antisocial personality disorder in the region in the period 1918-1980.

Croatia’s commemorative culture regarding the wars of the 20th century serves as a platform for politicians to operate within the nation-building narratives. Our project will analyze both top-down and bottom-up strategies of framing the nation and collective identities through commemorative practices of World War Two and the Homeland War in Croatia. These discourses will be analyzed at three levels: top-down political discourse (elites), media representation and transmission, and the reception of the narratives in Croatian society (bottom-up reactions). Seven commemorations related to World War 2 and the Homeland War will be observed and analyzed using corpus-based linguistic analysis and frame analysis. The media representations of the commemorative events and opinion poll data will likewise be analyzed in order to map how these discourses are transmitted and received in Croatian society. The project results will be disseminated via a regularly updated website (which includes a database of the collected research materials), journal articles, an edited volume, and papers presented at international conferences. Students and other members of the scholarly community will be encouraged to participate in the project through a variety of workshops to be held at the University of Rijeka.

Therefore, non-invasive purification methods upgrading their quality and sustainable production and ensuring stability of these fragile biomolecules are essential. This project will base purification on chromatography using monolith stationary phases which are featured by their suitability for biomolecules due to high porosity, high binding capacity and convective based transport. Ion-exchange and affinity chromatography will be employed and various conditions tested for obtaining target material with high purity and yield. Also, various formulation conditions enabling preservation of virus viability and protein functionality and stability throughout the process will be tested.

We start from the observation that the scholarly discourses in Croatia have so far not sufficiently acknowledged the cultural complexity of the economic sphere, especially the seminal significance of histories of Britain and America in that regard. Our methodological point of departure is therefore the assertion that the economic sphere can be understood only in reference to the entirety of culture. We intend to explore the complexity of this totality as refracted through cultural histories of Britain and America, as a horizon necessary for understanding Croatian cultural history. Our intent is to investigate complex interrelations of the sophisticated Victorian variant of capitalism and its American mutations, in the 19th and the 20th centuries. This applies primarily to Cold-War America, when capitalism contrasted to socialism becomes a totalizing formula to regulate various economic and political structures, but also the sphere of culture where public vs private is defined. Thus caught in relation to socialism, capitalism is definitive to life in the former Yugoslavia as well; this then sediments into a difficult genealogy which burdens capitalism when, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it enters formerly socialist countries, now as a platform for understanding and regulating postsocialism. Our approach is anchored in the assumption that research based only in economy or political theory fails to shed light on the logic of capitalism. This defines our methodology: we maintain that a truly functional analysis of the impact of capitalism demands a confluence of literary history, film studies, psychoanalysis, philosophy, cultural theory and, especially, the knowledge specific to English and American Studies.

Although DRG neurons are critical for the onset of neuropathic pain, there are no relevant clinical treatments for neuropathic pain that target this organ. With this proposal we aim to prove that neurostimulation techniques can be successfully used to manipulate neuronal function at the level of experimentally injured DRGs. In order to test this hypothesis we will construct a fully implantable neuronal stimulator for freely moving rats, devise an implantation technique and define stimulation protocols. This stimulator will be tested in rats with two types of experimentally induced nerve injury; spinal nerve ligation and carrageenan-induced inflammation model. Since this invasive procedure bears substantial risk of inflammation and other adverse neural tissue response, which can induce pain per se, we will also investigate connective tissue fibrosis and neuroinflammatory response in neural tissue of DRG and dorsal horn. The effect of the stimulation on excitability of injured DRG neurons will also be tested in vitro. Our last aim builds on our previous study in which we showed that neuronal injury may disable T-junction filtering and thereby increase the net conduction of afferent traffic. With this proposal we will test whether stimulation can modulate filtering properties of DRG T-junction. This will be addressed using recordings from injured sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia excised from adult rats, and recently developed methodology that will allow us to electrically visualize action potential propagation in DRG neurons grown over custom microelectrode arrays.

The subtle interplay of interactions is, in turn, a key ingredient for extraordinary complex phase diagrams exhibited by SCES. Even more interesting are regions of instabilities away from stable phases. The way a new phase emerges close to a phase boundary reveals hidden properties of the studied system. It is extremely important to understand how symmetry breaks in the transition itself and identify the space and time-scales relevant for the changes of order parameter within the transition. Sometimes an intermediate state emerges between two stable phases, bringing new physics to light.

This project proposal will explore some of methodologically complexities of volatility modelling and forecasting with respect to both the parametric and nonparametric approaches. Moreover, one of the objectives is to investigate news impact curve of different volatility models as well as to compare different types of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedascity models in terms of their ability to describe structural changes in returns and to explore if Markov regime switching GARCH models outperform uni-regime GARCH models in forecasting volatility when sudden switching occurs. According to previous commonly used aspects of volatility measurement and modelling, two relatively new approaches will be explored. First one relies on neural-networks as econometric tool. The second one combines panel methodology with GARCH models. It should be emphasized that new OHLC volatility estimator will be defined as the most efficient one when high frequency data is not available.

A practical objective of the proposed research project is to build an optimal economic growth/cycle model for Croatia using Advanced Growth Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm (AGSIFAL) that we plan to build. In order to do so, an algorithm (selected from the best of artificial neural network model, structural econometric model, dynamic general equilibrium model, nonlinear econometric model, golden triangle model) for cycle/growth sequencing and forecasting will be developed. Sequencing of the economic growth on a international scale (119 countries) will be performed using business cycle tracer methods and novel golden triangle model developed by Škare (2010). For this purpose, advanced cycle/growth algorithm will be created. Using individual country data as primer, we plan to isolate growth determinants using three dimensional golden triangle model and spectral analysis techniques. Output, inflation and employment form the three dimension of the cycle/growth triangle that will be used for sequencing growth. After a growth sequencing is finished, a best forecasting algorithm is built from the derived growth sequencing bases. Pairing isolated growth determinants help us to rebuild a growth sequence. Using different algorithm models, reconstructed economic growth series is compared to the actual growth series (observed data). Algorithm resulting in the smallest forecast error (RMSE) is selected as optimal to explain economic growth and predict business cycles.

Last two decades full hydraulic (distributive) models have been developed exclusively by conventional finite elements considering karst heterogeneity structure that improves our understanding of complex processes in karst.

Moreover, extending existing procedure to 3-D and constructing separate multi-scale solution for all three karst phases, proposed approach will enable the following impacts in comparison to conventional methods: desired spatial and temporal accuracy and high computational efficiency, modular model structure, incorporation of different heterogeneity scales related to existing measurements, enabling of transport and tracer test analysis and better understanding of karst aquifers due to solving of different engineering problems such as water usage and protection or contaminant pollution.

The evidence has been accumulated indicating the role of PVR and its receptors in immune surveillance including the control of viral infections, tumors, as well as in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Of note is that PVR is constitutively expressed on the majority of somatic cells, while its receptors are expressed on the majority of lymphocyte population. In many respects the interaction of PVR with its paired set of inhibitory and activating receptors resemble the interaction of paired co-stimulatory immune cell receptors and their cellular ligands (B7/CD28/CTLA-4). These co-stimulatory molecules have been the subject of intensive studies that resulted in immunoregulatory pharmaceutical agents for use in humans. The studies proposed here are based on the finding that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) affects the surface expression of PVR (Nat Immunol. 2005) and on our preliminary results indicating that mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) also downregulates mouse PVR. Thus, we first focused on the identification of MCMV gene(s) (proteins) involved in the PVR regulation, but also on the consequence of this viral regulation on antiviral immune response in vivo. To that aim we will generate MCMV mutants lacking viral regulators and test their in vivo susceptibility to components of innate and acquired immune response. We expect that the results obtained will further broaden the knowledge of PVR regulation and its significance in immune control, which will eventually help to translate this knowledge to developing new immunotherapeutic tools. Namely, one aim of this project is to engineer antibody specific for human PVR in order to be used as a tool in targeted tumor therapy. This idea is based on the fact that many tumors over-express PVR, which could be used in antibody mediated uptake of anti-tumor compounds.

This proposal investigates the molecular mechanism behind knockdown of integrins alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 using integrin subunit specific siRNAs (beta 3, beta 5, beta 6, alpha v, alpha 3, alpha 4 or alpha 5) and the ability of such a treatment to sensitise TNBC and melanoma cell lines to anticancer drugs paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. Our next goal is to identify how specific integrin knockdown influences cell migration and invasion. The focal adhesions (FA) are sites of attachment between cells and extracellular matrix which may mediate differential cell responses by variation of FA protein composition. Therefore, the FA protein composition will be investigated before and upon integrin silencing using proteomics methodology. We will monitor formation and temporal evolution of FA in living cells during spreading or migration using reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM). On the basis of these data, several signalling pathways will be proposed and their involvement in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion will be experimentally verified. Our data will contribute to the knowledge on integrin signalling pathways, structure and function of focal adhesions.

The electrification of the transport equipment and the shift of the freight shipments from road to more efficient rail are some of the key elements for the overall increase of energy efficiency in transport and reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions. This project puts emphasis on development of advanced electric drives for traction vehicles for passenger and freight transport running on tracks. Traditional approach to the design of electric drives has an emphasis on components without insufficient insight into the interaction among them and thus it fails to deliver the optimal performance of the overall traction system. The main objective of this project is to enhance the general approach to design of electric drive systems for traction applications by utilizing a synergetic approach to component design accompanied with advanced control algorithms to maximize the system performance and efficiency and minimize the life cycle cost of the vehicle. This objective will be achieved through: (i) development of software tools for computer aided design of electric drive components for traction applications using multiphysics approach with consideration of component interaction with the rest of the system, (ii) development of different traction power converters topologies for evaluation of various modulation and control methods, (iii) development of software environment for dynamic simulation of traction system performance which couples complex nonlinear models of system components with the models of control algorithm and vehicle dynamics, (iv) development of the electric drive control system based on optimal control approach which ensures maximum efficiency of the system during entire drive cycle of the vehicle.

Croatian transformer manufacturers are among a top few in the world, and their annual production is worth about €300 million, what is about 2% of the world production. It is possible to keep this position on the world market only if there is a close collaboration between the academic community and transformer manufacturers. Notable progress in technology of transformers is based on utilization of new materials and application of advanced design methodologies, which incorporate sophisticated numerical methods for modelling of processes in transformers. This project is focused on research and development of advanced numerical techniques for solving various electromagnetic phenomena in transformers and their application in design. Crucial subjects in transformer design are: insulation system, electromagnetic losses and windings. Consequently, researches within this project are organized in three subprojects: 1. New methods for design of insulating systems. The aim of this subproject is to develop new comprehensive numerical method for computation of electric fields within the insulating system. 2. Computation of electromagnetic losses with the aim to develop a new method of estimation of stray losses level of power transformer, as well as the methodology of simultaneous modelling of electromagnetic field, thermal field and fluid dynamics field in transformers. 3. High frequency modelling of windings. The objective of this subproject is to develop fast and accurate procedures for the determination of capacitances, inductances and resistances in high-frequency range. These elements will be used for creating an equivalent lumped-element circuit for determination of voltage stresses along a winding.

The primary challenge, in wider adoption of WDM-PON, lies in the development of sufficiently low cost technology to be used at the users’ premises. Self-seeded WDM-PON has been actively investigated in recent years as potentially the lowest cost solution for next-generation access networks. The primary attraction of this architecture is its simplicity, lower power consumption, and cost advantage. Similar principles can be applied to multiplexing and interrogation systems for optical sensors and our aim is to develop, analyze and demonstrate sustainable all-optical infrastructure based on extended cavity resonators able to provide physical layer for both, access communication and sensor networks. At University of Zagreb we invented an optical component, the modulation-averaging reflector, which reduces the penalty due to modulation of the seeding light and depolarizes the light oscillating in the cavity thereby stabilizing the extended resonator. This was the first step towards a future-proof optical access technology. Within this project we will fully develop and characterize systems based on extended cavity resonators with modulation averaging reflectors. We will also explore the use of modulation averaging concept in a novel communication optical source architecture based on wavelength re-use.

The first will include study of mechanisms of organic reactions in the solid state, and the second will mainly deal with the theoretical study of mechanisms in the solution. Mechanisms of the solid-state processes cannot be interpreted using the established concepts of reaction mechanisms because the phase change plays the crucial role in determining reaction kinetics and the structure of the products. Until now, papers published in this field represent mostly kinetics of phase transformations and descriptions of kinetic data by various mathematical models. As a result, the relationship between such a macroscopic approach and structural changes on the molecular level is still poorly understood. Knowledge about the principles of solid-state reactions is of broad interest, and especially useful to chemists who use solvent-free synthetic methods. In this research, we propose investigations of solid-state reactions based on our recent discoveries and explanations of mechanisms of dimerizations and polymerization of nitroso compounds. Using this established approach and corresponding molecular models, we plan to develop a mechanistic concept of the solid-state reactions, and use it to design novel supramolecular structures. As a starting point of our investigations of organic reaction mechanisms in the solution, we will finish development of our new cluster-continuum solvation model. It will provide us with the most important solute-solvent molecules clusters, allowing the realistic estimates of standard Gibbs energies of involved species and thus prediction of kinetic and thermodynamic data for the examined reactions.

The thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies that are planned to be analysed are: free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, thyroid microsomal antibody titer, thyroglobulin antibody titer and parathiroid hormone. In addition, detailed anamnestic data and phenotype measurements already taken from study participants will be used in realization of second and third project objectives: investigation of relevant gene-environment interactions and determination of phenotype-phenotype correlation. We plan to follow-up interesting findings in additional 2,000 individuals and in datasets sought through international collaboration. Outcomes of such comprehensive approach will be generation of a new knowledge of genetic background, gene-environment interaction and phenotype-phenotype correlation associated with thyroid and parathyroid function that will lead to better understanding of biological pathways and clinically relevant disorders related to their function. The obtained results will promote excellence of Croatian research.

Therefore, there is a necessity for developing novel molecular approaches to treat this disease. Unlike other tumors, in melanoma p53 is relatively rarely mutated. However, overexpressed p53 fails to function as a tumor suppressor and tumor cells continue to proliferate and spread. This suggests that regulation of p53 activity depends on the interplay between p53 and its binding partners. Based on current state of knowledge, we hypothesize that p53 function in malignant melanoma might be altered through the interactions with p53 small molecular weight and p73 isoforms, nm23/NDPK and Gli families of proteins. Thus we will search for p53 protein binding partners in melanoma. The interactions identified by mass spectrometry will be further confirmed using microarray-based approaches and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. Furthermore, the expression profile of genes/proteins of interest in panel of melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue samples will be investigated. The potential impact of the identified p53 interacting partners on its transcriptional activity and the stimulation of apoptosis will be determined. The depletion of partners using siRNA technology would confirm the involvement of selected proteins on p53 activity. The subcellular localization of the proteins in complex will be revealed by advanced fluorescent microscopy methods on state-of-the-art instrumentation what would give us the insight on dynamics of their interactions. The proposed research could provide a possible explanation why p53 function in melanoma is abrogated. The aim of this project is to determine the complexity of p53 interactions and their role in the onset and progression of human melanoma and offer new, innovative solutions in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

These accidents have resulted in the loss of cargo, pollution of environment, and most unfavorable the loss of life. Accidental damages of ships can occur in any number of ways. The two cases which exhibit most concerns are the collision between ships and hard grounding on seabed.

It would reveal submolecular details important for substrate stabilization and, in the case of h.DPP III, the enzymatic mechanism. Elucidation of the key interactions between h.DPP III and Keap1 protein (Nrf2-Keap1 signalling pathway is major regulator of cytoprotective responses to oxidative and electrophilic stress), and possible correlation of DPP III flexibility with the complex stability, should aid in clarification of its cellular roles. Plant DPP III, differently from DPP IIIs in other organisms possesses a NUDIX box. The project should elucidate its potential dual activity (peptidase and NUDIX). Study of DPP III from thermophile should improve our knowledge on thermophile proteins, potentially useful in biotechnology. In order to fulfill the outlined goals a finely tuned multidisciplinary approach would be used in which molecular biology, biochemistry and mass spectrometry methods would be complemented with bioinformatics, multiscale molecular modeling (coarse grained/all atom MD, QM/MM) and macromolecular crystallography.

It focuses on accounts of plural belongings and hybrid identities that are geographically grounded, socio-economically situated and embedded in cultural and linguistic practices manifested by multilingualism and intercultural competence of social scripts and behaviour. The project will cover spatially and regionally confined patterns of interaction in the Croatian part of Istria, and the cities of Pula and Zadar under direct Habsburg influence and in the cities of Rijeka and Zagreb, politically bound to the Hungarian part of the Empire during the period 1870-1918. The main strains of research will focus on uncovering discourses produced through three social spaces, those of institutions (administration and education), associations (cultural, sport), and those visible in everyday life, through consumption practices and tourism. The analyses will encompass social practices in different domains of life, symbolic system (focusing on language) and the use of artifacts, or material life. The specific objective is to provide a contrastive reading of Austro-German, Italian and Slavic sources illuminating both the established discourses of knowledge production, emanating from imperial centres of Vienna and Budapest, and the counter-discourses, and their reception by common people in the periphery.

The ultimate goal of the proposed experiments, together with other experimental and theoretical investigations, is to provide crucial pieces of information for the understanding how hadrons emerge from their fundamental constituents - the quarks and gluons, why the colour is confined, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the nucleon is much heavier than its constituents. The main objectives in electron scattering experiments at MAMI are: cross section determination of the p(e,e’ ?+)n reaction at Q2=0.078 (GeV/c)2, the lowest measured value till now, of crucial relevance for axial nucleon form factor determination, measurements of virtual Compton scattering in the momentum transfer range of relevance for nucleon structure determination, investigations of 12C(e,epp)10Be and simultaneous measurement of 12C(e,epp)10Be and 12C(e,e’pn)10B reactions of relevance for determination of the role of quark degrees of freedom in nuclei and also for understanding of cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars. The main objectives in the kaonic atoms experiments at LNF are: upgrade of SIDDHARTA setup in order to reach desired resolution and subsequently high precision measurements of transitions in kaonic deuterium, 3He and 4He, that should yield isospin dependent kaon-nucleon scattering lengths. Their precise determination will put strong constraints on the low-energy kaon-nucleon dynamics and eventually constrain the SU(3) description of chiral symmetry breaking.

Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical process carried out in the absence of oxygen that yields with three different end-products – bio-oil, biochar and syngas. Pyrolysis of agricultural residues can help meet renewable energy targets by displacing fossil fuels and, thereby, deal with concerns regarding the global warming. Unlike direct combustion, pyrolysis yields with more end-products. Bio-oil has environmental benefits as a clean fuel and causes less pollution as compared to fossil fuels, whereas biochar can be put on soil and act as a carbon-sequestering and climate-mitigating agent. Based on the above-mentioned, the overall objective of this project is to determine the potential of different types of biomass residues and waste, and dedicated crops, for bio-oil and biochar production via pyrolysis. Since the type of feedstock significantly influences the pyrolysis process and the yield of end-products, the specific objective of the proposed project will be to determine the potential of pyrolysis from different biomass feedstock collected in two climatically different regions, Mediterranean and Continental Croatia.

Phraseology is primarily a linguistic and culturally multi-layered discipline. The basic unit of phraseology is a phraseme (idiom). It consists of at least two components. Its characteristic is that it is not created in the process of speaking, but is included in discourse as an already known whole. Its main features are continuity of use, integrity and a solid structure, higher or lower degree of desemanticization, a colourful nature, expressiveness and connotative meaning. The project will primarily include theoretical work on analyzing Croatian phrasemes from various aspects. Furthermore, with the application of the method of contrastive analysis, structural, semantic, etymological, motivational and cultural similarities and differences between Croatian idioms and idioms of other Slavic and non-Slavic languages will be examined. We consider the latter to be extremely important because in this way Croatian idioms would be placed in the context of European idioms. The second part of the project proposal relates to phraseographical work. Phraseography is an area that deals with the issue of compiling phraseological dictionaries. The publication of several phraseological dictionaries is planned. Particularly important will be the two phraseological dictionaries which will be completely new in a conceptual sense (a trilingual dictionary of associations and a dictionary of gender-marked phrasemes). All dictionaries will be compiled according to the latest phraseographical methodology. In addition, we should mention the work on the updated edition of the Bibliography of Croatian phraseology.

Rural areas account for almost 90% of the land and are home to almost half of the population, both in Croatia and the EU. They are still the most important food production zones in Europe, although this primary function has been challenged by numerous modernization and globalization processes and complemented by other economic, social, cultural, and environmental functions. As a result, we have witnessed the (re)emergence of heterogeneous and diversified rural areas, juxtaposing depopulation and land abandonment in some regions, and tourist development or agricultural intensification in others. Given their size, population number, functions and variety of challenges they face, the question of future of rural areas is one of the most pressing issues in Europe today. This is evident from recent scenario-based approaches to study future trends and driving forces for rural Europe, both in academic and political discourse, on national and EU level (e.g. SCENAR 2020, EURURALIS etc.). On the other hand, although the majority of rural areas in Croatia face tremendous demographic and economic challenges, to our knowledge no scenario-based research has been done and only a few partial impact analyses have been conducted in recent Croatian agricultural policy. Therefore, the main objectives of the CRORURIS study are as follows: 1. to develop a conceptual framework for understanding recent change in rural Croatia; 2. to develop methodological framework for identifying predominant trends and key uncertainties, differentiating them geographically and projecting them forward using statistical modelling and Delphi method; 3. to construct alternative future scenarios and relate them to the context of rural Europe.

Therefore, the main objective is to provide an assessment of structure behaviour, by comparing of the parameters like stress, strain, crack occurring, etc., caused by certain load level and temperature at this unexpected limit state with those allowed by material properties. To assess structural behaviour in operation at limit state, the following research sub-objectives should be accomplished: testing of material properties for the different environmental conditions; definition of impact energy as well as the determination of the crack driving force and life assessment of structural elements; evaluation of the semi-rigid structural joints/connections behaviour; development of a numerical algorithm for optimization of semi-rigid framed structures; creep buckling simulations of composite beam-type structures; proper constitutive modelling at limit operating conditions (i.e. plasticity, damage, thermomechanical coupling); application of new materials to be used at limit state – nanocomposites.

Drago Marguš', 'Natural protected areas (NPAs) are a crucial part of nature conservation; many of them are tourist hotspots. Managers of NPAs have to balance environmental protection and tourism to maximize socio-economic benefits while avoiding irreparable environmental consequences. Since 1978, carrying capacity for tourists (CCT) has been recognized and legislated as a crucial tool in finding the balance. CCT is traditionally defined as the maximum number of people concurrently visiting an area without irreversibly damaging physical, economic, and/or socio-cultural environment. In practice, managers determine acceptable level of environmental damage, and then use adaptive management to achieve and maintain that damage level. We propose a more conservation-oriented approach of estimating CCT that maximizes nature protection. Although every tourist damages the environment, he/she also contributes to protection by providing financial assets. Without revenues from tourism, protection is significantly underfunded because meeting protection and educational goals of NPAs requires costly activities such as research, oversight, mitigation, and management. We propose to estimate CCT as the maximum number of visitors for which the marginal contribution to nature protection is positive, with the requirement that visitor satisfaction not be compromised. We will first formalize the estimation procedure, then identify tourist activities with their consequences on the environment and socio-economic parameters, develop general models for common factors affecting environmental quality of the NPAs, and integrate the models into a GIS-based framework. Finally, we will demonstrate the approach by estimating CCT for two very different protected areas crucial for Croatian tourism and the local economy: NP Krka and PP Telašćica. While the new way of estimating CCT will initiate a paradigm shift in NPA management, the two applications will contribute to Croatia''s nature conservation and economy.

To successfully overcome this important career transition period, adolescents have to become aware of their preferences and capabilities, to crystallize their career goals and to form their vocational identity. By implementing their vocational identity through engagement in their desired job or educational program, they should be able to achieve success and satisfactions in their careers, to fit in and adjust to their working environment and job demands, and to be motivated for their work and future advancement. The Adolescent Career Transition Model encompasses several career related behaviours, competences and traits that can influence positive career transition outcomes. We will assess approximately 1200 high school students at the beginning of the last grade of high-school (17-18 years) and follow their career development for the next 18 months. In three separate time points we will administer measures of career-related traits and social support, career self-guidance competencies, vocational development and career transition outcomes, through a secure online testing system that will be developed for this project. Statistical data analysis of the obtained data will be performed by adequate multivariate models to answer specific research objectives. Once the postulation and evaluation of the ACTM and the dissemination of the results are completed, the aim of the project is to create a new online career guidance system on the basis of the results of our research.

Ions are very efficient in creating numerous ionizations on their path through the material by ejecting/exciting electrons (electron stopping) and in creating vacancies by recoiling the whole atoms (nuclei) from their lattice sites (nuclear stopping). Therefore, irradiation of materials with energetic ion beams is considered as a) an efficient tool to alter materials physical, chemical, electrical and optical properties and b) a sensitive probe that can be used to characterise materials using some of the Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) methods. Understanding of complicated dynamical processes that lead to structural modifications of materials requires the knowledge of experimental data related to kinematics of defects during and after irradiation. Therefore the goal of the present proposal is experimental study of the time evolution of radiation induced changes induced by energetic (MeV) ion beams and their characterization using the RBI Tandem Accelerator Facility. The focus will be on studying: (i) influence of electronic stopping and related nanostructuring of materials by ion track methodology; (ii) influence of nuclear stopping to radiation damage and amorphization in crystals, including crystalline and functional materials of interest for future fusion reactors; (iii) charge transport properties in crystalline materials, focusing on novel semiconductor materials for radiation detection. Experimental methodology relies mostly on the unique RBI dual-beam end station that will be used for ion beam irradiations and simultaneous characterization of induced changes using IBA methods like RBS and PIXE in channelling mode, ERDA, NRA and PIGE, as well as IBIC (Ion Beam Induced Charge).

The field of socio-behavioural research on SEM has been marred by inability to distinguish between associations and causal links. The only available European panel study followed Dutch youth for only 12 months. To enable a more robust assessment of the links between SEM use and sexual socialization, health, and intimacy we propose to set up a 3-year panel sample with over 1,000 high-school students. The panel would be used to carry out biological testing on males (testosterone levels from saliva) and repeated online surveying in which the genre and the frequency of SEM use would be analyzed as predictors of subsequent sexual activity (particularly, sexual risk taking), the dynamics of attitudes toward women and committed relationships. We propose to test a conceptual model in which possible SEM influences on the outcomes are influenced by T levels, personality traits, family environment, characteristics of ego-centered social network, type of SEM used, and sexual experiences. Our biopsychosocial model aims to assess the contribution of SEM use to the process of young people’s sexual socialization, while controlling for the effects of biological makeup, intrapersonal characteristics, and interpersonal and group (family, peer group, partners) social influences.

Preliminary analysis can be conducted using computer codes based on engineering methods, the most used one based on point-kernel method. Recent research indicated that a new approach can be used in determination of buildup factors as the key parameters of point-kernel method. The approach is based on machine learning technique, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR). For efficient training of the SVR models of a complex physical problem, an active learning procedure has to be defined. Final shielding analysis is usually conducted by computer codes based on either deterministic or statistic methods placing high time and hardware demands, but resulting in more accurate results. Advanced numerical procedures utilize advantages of both, deterministic approach as well as stochastic approach resulting in a hybrid deterministic-stochastic procedure increasing the efficiency of the overall analysis. The overall objective of the proposed project is the development of the synthesized calculational tool to enable all stages of a shield design to be performed within integrated environment. To accomplish this objective following activities are planned: definition of the optimal active learning procedure in regression framework to prepare data sets for SVR model creation, investigation of gamma and neutron buildup factors and preparation of SVR models, development of the computational tool for preliminary stage shielding design, optimization of hybrid deterministic-stochastic numerical procedure, development of the control module for automatic shielding analyses process control, preparation of front-end and back-end interface, testing of the final shielding analysis environment.

Besides its primary purpose, land administration system can and should also serve as a basis for land management. Different to the land administration, land management is a set of processes ensuring that the land is used in an efficient and sustainable manner. Unfortunately, land administration systems are rarely able to fulfill such additional requirements, even in the developed countries. This project aims at finding what needs to be done in order to transform a traditional land administration system into a modern multipurpose land administration system (MLAS), which can efficiently support land management. Our hypothesis says that such a transformation can be done by improving two aspects of a LAS, its efficiency and its usability. Under efficiency we consider the ability of a LAS to update its data quickly whilst ensuring the consistency and correctness thereof. Within the project we will investigate options for outsourcing the preparation of transactions to private sector and the possibilities to more efficiently collect field data within the improved process of updating LAS data. Even more important that its efficiency, is the usability of a LAS. This is the second aspect that we try to improve within the project. Besides the mere registration of the land, MLAS must be able to efficiently support processes of land valuation, urban planning and various rearrangements aiming to increase agricultural productivity of the land. Within the project we will investigate which additional data needs to be collected, processed and stored within the LAS in order to enable efficient support to land management processes. As a starting point for the research we use our previous research closely related to the topics of land administration and land management, and the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), which recently became the ISO standard.

The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion. Antioxidant is a foreign substance that reacts with the oxidant faster than the components of the cell. An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favour of the oxidants is termed oxidative stress. Antioxidants act as free radical scavengers and therefore can lower the risk of numerous degenerative diseases by preventing damages caused by free radicals. Fruits and vegetables are the major sources of antioxidants in human diet. Several natural compounds found in food, such as polyphenols, vitamins A and E, and some carotenoids, have been found to show excellent antioxidant activity. Chlorophylls and their derivatives have also been reported to possess this activity. However, literature is still scarce regarding their antioxidant properties. It is known that the amount of each antioxidant in fruits, vegetables and their derivatives is strongly influenced by numerous factors such as agro-technical processes, environmental conditions, processing factors and storage conditions. Continuous monitoring of antioxidant capacity of plant-based foods through different phases, from cultivation to storage, is needed to maintain or even improve the beneficial properties of food. The goal of this project is to develop several cyclic multi-pulse voltammetric techniques for the characterization of natural antioxidants and to apply them in routine analysis of food quality.

RecA functions in the form of nucleoprotein filaments that are assembled on single-stranded DNA, and which catalyze pairing and strand exchange between two homologous DNA duplexes. In Escherichia coli, the RecBCD and RecFOR protein complexes mediate RecA filament assembly, and consequently, play an important role in recombination. We have recently discovered that some E. coli mutants recombine quite efficiently in the absence of both RecBCD and RecFOR complexes. This recombination is RecA-dependent suggesting the existence of an alternative RecA loading activity. The aim of the project is to genetically characterize this RecBCD- RecFOR-independent (RecBFI) recombination pathway, and gain insight into this novel mechanism of RecA filament assembly. Although RecA is crucial for efficient recombination in bacteria, the recA mutants of radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans display a significant residual ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Recent results from our group have shown that this RecA-independent repair is quite inaccurate leading to gross chromosome rearrangements. Our project is to identify the key genes/proteins involved in this RecA-independent repair, and to characterize, at the sequence level, gross genome rearrangements in D. radiodurans. Given that recombination is a fundamental process largely conserved during evolution, our research on bacteria may reveal molecular mechanisms that are applicable to eukaryotic recombination systems.

Within this research various carbonate sediments from different climate zones will be studied: speleothems from 3 locations in littoral Croatia, mountainous Gorski Kotar region and central Croatia, lake sediments from Plitvice Lakes, tufa deposits from Zrmanja River, and marine algal rims from ~8 locations along the eastern Adriatic coast. Research will be based on isotopic methods that include analyses of stable isotope ratios 13C/12C and 18O/16O in carbonate deposits, 2H/1H and 18O/16O in water, and radioactive isotopes 14C and U-Th series for dating. Stable isotopes in carbonates will provide information about past environmental conditions, temperature variations, lake evaporation, bioactivity and productivity, and indicate the origin of carbon and mechanisms of calcite precipitation. Algal rims serve as good and precise sea-level indicators and additionally their morphology, age and stable isotope composition could be directly linked to climate changes. The expected outcome is the estimation of regional response of the environment in Croatia to global changes during the Quaternary, and of differences in response of various carbonates to paleoenvironmental changes and their correlations.

Third, we will argue that some problems with compatibilistic accounts are more serious than has hitherto been recognized. This is due, first, to the fact that, in our opinion, compatibilism is also susceptible to a specific luck objection, and second, to the fact that it is sometimes based on insufficiently clear notions of causality, determinism and natural laws. Fourth, we will argue that Aristotelian version of compatibilism can bring some fresh light to contemporary discussions, but that it is also susceptible to a specific luck objection. Research activities can be grouped under five main headings: 1. Causality, laws of nature and luck (1.1. Causality, laws of nature and action; 1.2. Indeterminism and luck; 1.3. The varieties of determinism), 2. Brain, mind and agency (2.1. Freedom and consciousness, 2.2. Mental causation and ascriptions of intentionality, 2.3. Some perspectives from neuroscience), 3. Moral responsibility (3.1. Principle of Alternative Possibilities, 3.2. Bioenhancement and responsibility), 4. Aristotelian perspective (4.1. Aristotle’s compatibilism, 4.2. Aristotle on moral responsibility and luck), 5. Free will, determinism and the quantum rescue.

The goal of this Installation Research Project is to establish a group of researchers in the Croatian Geological Survey (CGS), Department of Geology, to additionally equip and train them, so they could standardise and carry out their research of Quaternary sediments of Croatia applying new analytical techniques and new scientific findings. Those new compositional data will enable correlating our results with the EU, especially for the middle and south Europe.

During the first year we plan to get know new equipment, methodology and to investigate all the different types of Quaternary sediments in Croatia. In the second and third year plan is to scrutinize the sediments in selected area in the each region (Pannonian and Dinaric). The strategic importance of Quaternary sediments for Croatia is based partly on the agricultural utilization of the Holocene soils developed on these deposits and partly as a collector of drinking water, reflecting to the whole biosphere. Furthermore, the hydrogeological properties of separate horizons of Quaternary sediments are different, so, insight in the structures of sediment layers could lead to finding new water resources.

The mechanisms of aging and possible actions of slowing down or ameliorating aging-related processes are poorly understood. In humans, one of the characteristics of old age is polypharmacy, which elevates risks of drug-drug interactions and drug-induced adverse reactions and organ toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These reactions may partially result from diminished drug metabolism and/or mainly from impaired activity/expression of various membrane transporters that are responsible for drug excretion in liver and kidneys. These both mechanisms have been poorly studied in senescent organs. Here we promote a hypothesis that the aging-induced oxidative stress, known to downregulate the activity/expression of the aging suppressor gene (Klotho) and to shorten the length of telomeres, also diminishes the activity/expression of various membrane transporters in liver and kidneys, and that these changes can be ameliorated by treating animals with antioxidants resveratrol and melatonin. The extent and the intensity of aging-related changes, and the beneficial effects of antioxidants may be sex-related. To test this hypothesis, we propose various biochemical and cell- and molecular-biological studies of aging parameters and aging-dependent expression of various membrane transporters in the mammalian liver and kidneys using a rat model of experimental aging. Possible aging-related decline in the expression of these transporters may explain a higher incidence (women &gt; man) of drug interactions and toxicity in old people. The studies will define the underlying cellular mechanisms that contribute to generation of the aging-related pathophysiological conditions in the liver and kidneys, and will indicate possible ways of their amelioration. Positive results may point to remedies to be used for improving the health of elderly people.

We commonly use stochastic models to describe such behaviour and rely on stochastic methods to gain insights, make forecasts or inference about them. Various stochastic methods have appeared over the years in biology, medicine, biomedicine, geology, climatology, social sciences, finance and insurance, and many other scientific fields. The area of mathematics that lies in the background is probability theory, in particular, theory of stochastic processes. It is a rich mathematical theory with proven potential to solve not only applied problems, but also some quite theoretical problems coming from other areas of mathematics. The problems that we plan to study can be broadly divided into four groups: 1. Analysis and potential theory of Markov processes, 2. Stochastic methods in modelling heavy tailed phenomena, 3. Stochastic methods in harmonic analysis, and 4. Stochastic methods in biomedical and social sciences problems. This choice of problems is influenced by importance in the current international research as well as the background and expertise of members of our team. The goal of the project is to advance understanding of the role of randomness in each of these four settings. The unifying feature behind our approach to these problems is common stochastic methods in their analysis. These methods include, but are not limited to, martingale methods, point processes and random measure methods, potential-theoretic methods (both probabilistic and analytic), Markov processes methods, methods from the Dirichlet form theory, stochastic integrals, diffusion processes, branching processes and measure-valued processes methods, time-series methods, wavelets and methods for statistical inference.

Intrinsic properties of the materials can be modified by exploiting dynamic and specific uni-directional interactions among building blocks, thus allowing construction of novel supramolecular structures.

Together with the largest historical data set in the wider area and the most advanced approaches (in situ pH and phytoplankton physiology, taxonomy and analyses of metabolic activities), it will allow us an exhaustive insight in these interactions.

The aim of this project is to investigate new materials and techniques for antenna fabrication including conductive textiles and threads. A textile antenna integrated into clothes must be lightweight, flexible, and comfortable to wear, but still must keep good radiation properties.

Adopting a broad perspective it will take into account most diverse aspects of identity, such as social, political, religious, ethnic, or individual, as well as their interactions. This requires investigation of diverse historical sources which range from texts (e.g. historiography, diplomatic correspondence, notary records), to social practices (e.g. ritual) or urban topography and visual arts. Besides such comprehensiveness, another important novelty of the project is its chronological scope. It takes into account long period of almost half a millennium, thereby disregarding the conventional divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, which will enable valuable insights into long term (dis)continuities. Yet another important novelty is that the project focuses on a premodern city-state, a type of community relatively neglected in the field of identity studies mostly focused on modern period and national states. Finally, the project will also adopt a strongly comparative perspective, investigating the (dis)similarities between Dubrovnik and other Mediterranean cities. Since the enterprise of this scope necessarily involves specialists in different fields and methodologies, the project assembles an interdisciplinary team led by the Academician Nenad Vekarić. It consists of ten scientists, two postdoctoral researchers and four doctoral students. The project proposes to publish more than 10 scientific books, numerous articles, and organize four workshops.

The link between the two is poorly understood. There is growing evidence that OSAS contributes to the initiation and progression of hypertension, heart failure, cardiac ischemia, stroke and cognitive decline. Chronic sympathetic activation resulting in elevated sympathetic nerve activity and cardio-respiratory sensitivity to hypoxia appears to be important. Still, the exact mechanisms underlying the link between OSA and cardiovascular and neurophysiologic disturbances are not completely known. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) in experimental animals can mimic periods of repeated apneas seen in OSAS patients. Exposure to repeated bouts of hypoxia in human leads to increased sympathetic activity, whilst intermittent hypoxia in experimental animals evokes increases in phrenic and sympathetic nerve activities. The proposed study will examine the role of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (e.g. serotonin and opioids) in evoking sympathetic long-term facilitation using anesthetized animal model of IH. The only way to understand complex pathophysiological interactions in OSAS patients is to use translational and multidisciplinary approach, as proposed in this project. Our focus in the human studies is to study neurophysiologic (brain motor control, control of breathing, neurographic features of peripheral nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity) function in OSAS patients and the links to metabolic, stress, and cognitive parameters. Preliminary data from pilot studies suggest it is possible to achieve the new findings using this novel approach.

We propose to measure the magnetisation and specific heat in the whole doping range to extract the total density of states at the Fermi level and thereby determine the number of pockets. At the same time we will look for thermodynamic signatures of the CDW phase transitions. Other unresolved controversies which will be investigated include the doping evolution of the mean-field upper critical field and whether Gaussian superconducting fluctuations can account for the magnetisation and specific heat of both underdoped and overdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals at T&gt;Tc. In the field of TI, we will investigate the thermoelectric properties of bismuth based chalcogenide (BiSbTeSe2) and 3D Dirac semimetals and to find the evidence of the linear dispersion and nontrivial topology of these materials.

The major applications of trehalose have been in science, medicine and cosmetic sectors due to its natural functionality, mechanism of action and technical qualities. The limiting factor of trehalose use in the food industry used to be the ingredient cost but with development of a new manufacturing process, the cost of trehalose production has been dramatically reduced.

Practical application of project results would be valuable for new food product development.

We believe that the changes of structure and expression of the selected genes correlate with the phenotypic changes of tumor cells. EMT is a process very much involved in invasion and progression of tumors. Many oncogenic signaling pathways can induce EMT. The classical Wnt pathway has a particularly tight link with EMT and it has been shown that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin can induce EMT. Wnt pathway is one of the basic cellular pathways whose misregulation plays important roles in tumorigenesis and whose mediators of transcription are members of TCF/LEF family. Another important protein family is the Dishevelled considered to be the central hub of Wnt signaling since it interacts with Wnt receptors and recruits the multiprotein beta-catenin destruction complex. The experiments of the proposed research will use modern methods of molecular biology for the analyses of brain tumor samples of different malignancy grades. The genetic changes will be tracked by PCR/loss of heterozygosity, heteroduplex and Spreadex electorphoresis (Elchrom Scientific, Switzerland) methods. Expression of selected proteins will be studied by immunohistochemistry demonstrating their location in tumor cells. Besides its scientific value, results from the proposed project will have an application in medical diagnostics. Identifying changes in molecules responsible for control of cell motility will give us the preconditions for understanding the invasiveness of brain tumors and offer new disease progression markers.

This is different from real operating conditions where range of applied powers and types of excitation signals is various and very often far away from linear. The neglect of these nonlinearities in active and passive materials, used in the complete US system construction process, leads to the problem of the US systems’ efficiency factor in the nonlinear driving conditions. The construction of modular measurement system with included and modified interferometry and time of flight principle with added new measurement procedure is crucial for developing novel US systems with higher electroacoustic efficiency factors. The new method is based on tracking the resonant frequency changes of the nonlinear electro-mechanical-acoustical system for determination complex material parameters. The new modular measurement system will enable exposure of materials to the US fields with various driving conditions. Tracking the resonant frequency changes of excitated loading medium sample (active piezoceramic or passive construction elements or different types of loading mediums) is novel method for determination of material parameters when nonlinear effects appear in the loading mediums.

At the same time, the addition of the masonry wall to the frame tends to increase the base-shear response and reduce the drift capacity of the structure. The increase of lateral force and reduction of drift capacity leads to serious vulnerabilities unless proper proportioning is exercised. For frames with competent walls, the challenge for safe and economical design is to be able to take advantage of the stiffening but to make certain that the increase in lateral forces and reduction in drift capacity do not handicap performance. Available evidence has pointed out that shear strength of the confining column is the ''''Achiless''s heel'''' of the system. Solution of the problem requires understanding the behavior of masonry and concrete subjected to dynamic and random loading reversals, a challenge that demands testing under reasonably realistic conditions for confident analysis of the problem and its generalization. This is a proposal to investigate the safety and behavior of buildings with masonry-infilled r-c frames through near full-scale dynamic earthquake-simulation tests accompanied by supporting pseudo-dynamic tests of structural assemblies and components and by calibrated analytical solutions. The overall goal is to develop pragmatic methods, by cooperative efforts of team members and co-working international body, for design, safety evaluation and standardization.

EU policies require that non-destructive methods for assessment and monitoring replace destructive harvest-based methods currently in widespread use, and these methods are among the most scientifically supported non-destructive methods currently available. These methods will be used to quantify fish community structure and benthic habitat at all major MPAs and former MPAs in Croatia, to compare communities within MPAs to matched locations outside MPAs. Matched locations will be chosen to test for specific anthropogenic drivers of community structure, such as high fishing pressure, coastal development, marine tourism, aquaculture, and terrestrial runoff.

Especially difficult situation occurs when loading is stochastic (e.g. wind, earthquake, traffic) since there is no direct relation between loading (input) and displacements (output). System parameter identification will be based on inverse mathematical formulation so to present a reliable and theoretically sound procedure for identification of required parameters. One of the main goals of the system identification procedure is representative volume identification. It will be necessary to consider non-Gaussian stochastic processes with heavy tails characterizing dangerous rare events. Regarding material parameters this project advocates the hypothesis that the fracture energy of a material is approximately constant and that the material constitutive law should not incorporate “rate effect”. The idea of (approximately) constant fracture energy for all loading rates is new and important in models of concrete under the dynamic loading. Also, the inclusion of the viscous parameter in the existing 3D microplane model for concrete is of vital importance for fatigue analysis since it connects creep and shrinkage (internal material loading) with dynamic loading (external structural loading). In the end the developed concrete model will account for corrosion by coupling the mechanical properties of concrete and properties affecting the transport of humidity, oxygen and chloride (chemo-hygro-thermo-mechanical model). The calibration of the 3D model and its verification will be performed based on the simulation of the corresponding experimental tests from the laboratory and the available literature according to the procedure for system parameter identification described above.

Recently, the traditionally produced food came into the focus which led to more often use of geographical indications (protected designation of origin-PDO, protected geographical indication-PGI and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed-TSG) as the valuable rural development strategy. Since Black Slavonian pig is a late maturing breed characterized by low lean meat percentage, meat processors tend to use the meat of modern pig breeds in production of traditional products. Therefore there is a need for scientifically developed methods in order to trace the origin of materials used in such production. First of all, molecular identification of breed will be performed by the use of MC1R gene and 18 microsatelite primers . Since the genotype, age and sex are possible sources of variation of the meat quality traits in pigs, the objective of proposed research is to determine the optimal time for slaughter with respect to these factors. The genetic influence on meat quality traits is nowadays well described by the use of molecular markers by which many of the candidate genes were discovered. In proposed research a special interest will be placed at some of them such as IGF2, MC4R, H-FABP3 and LEPR. The investigation of sensory traits and chemical analysis of meat and meat products will help to determine the typical physico-chemical characteristics and sensory profile of autochthonic Slavonian dry-cured meat products and fresh meat originated from Black Slavonian Pig meat.

We start from the observation that the scholarly discourses in Croatia have so far not sufficiently acknowledged the cultural complexity of the economic sphere, especially the seminal significance of histories of Britain and America in that regard. Our methodological point of departure is therefore the assertion that the economic sphere can be understood only in reference to the entirety of culture. We intend to explore the complexity of this totality as refracted through cultural histories of Britain and America, as a horizon necessary for understanding Croatian cultural history. Our intent is to investigate complex interrelations of the sophisticated Victorian variant of capitalism and its American mutations, in the 19th and the 20th centuries. This applies primarily to Cold-War America, when capitalism contrasted to socialism becomes a totalizing formula to regulate various economic and political structures, but also the sphere of culture where public vs private is defined. Thus caught in relation to socialism, capitalism is definitive to life in the former Yugoslavia as well; this then sediments into a difficult genealogy which burdens capitalism when, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it enters formerly socialist countries, now as a platform for understanding and regulating postsocialism. Our approach is anchored in the assumption that research based only in economy or political theory fails to shed light on the logic of capitalism. This defines our methodology: we maintain that a truly functional analysis of the impact of capitalism demands a confluence of literary history, film studies, psychoanalysis, philosophy, cultural theory and, especially, the knowledge specific to English and American Studies.

It will enable numerous physicians to acquire the trunk surface (TS). TS symmetry is one of the key elements in diagnostic and evaluation of various treatments in patients with trunk deformities. Common radiographic evaluation methods are known to expose patients to a radiation and, besides, radiography is actually 2D representation of 3D problem which has been shown not to be directly related to the shape of the back. Thus, there has been a constant motivation among researchers at (inter)national level to develop an optimal methodology for 3D reconstruction of the back. Still, most of those developed systems are mainly directed to 3D reconstruction of the spine and calculation of the Cobb angle which is still regarded by many as the gold standard method to measure scoliotic deformity. Still, the Cobb angle alone cannot explain the whole of the surface deformity. Evidently, there is high need to investigate development of a 3D reconstruction system which will capture both back and front of the patient, i.e. the entire trunk surface. In turn it would enable a more thorough analysis of the patient’s deformity pattern, i.e. a second major goal during this project is to derive other parameters (not only Cobb angle) in order to quantify trunk deformities.

Research results indicate the increased scope of workload and demands for new approaches to teaching, disharmony between teaching and research, increasing administrative duties, and the insistence on a stronger connection between the academic community and social environment. This project aims to determine how academics in Croatia assess the relevance of various competences, and how they assess, perceive and interpret possession of various competences that shape contemporary academic profession. It is expected that the research results in a proposal of the academic profession’ competence framework. In the research quantitative and qualitative methodological approach (survey and semi-structured interview) will be used. The survey consists of the competence framework elements which are to be evaluated by the participants in terms of the assessment of their (1) relevance and (2) possession. The interviews will explore the deeper perception of academics and challenging issues within the framework, and gain a ‘holistic’ (comprehensive, systemic, integrated) understanding of context, while capturing data on the participants perceptions ‘from the inside’. The final definition of an integrated competence framework which includes different dimensions of the academic profession is an original research contribution. Bearing in mind that the research of the academic profession is neglected in the national research discourse, the results of this study will also be a starting point for defining recommendations for (national) educational policies.

The mechanisms of aging and possible actions of slowing down or ameliorating aging-related processes are poorly understood. In humans, one of the characteristics of old age is polypharmacy, which elevates risks of drug-drug interactions and drug-induced adverse reactions and organ toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These reactions may partially result from diminished drug metabolism and/or mainly from impaired activity/expression of various membrane transporters that are responsible for drug excretion in liver and kidneys. These both mechanisms have been poorly studied in senescent organs. Here we promote a hypothesis that the aging-induced oxidative stress, known to downregulate the activity/expression of the aging suppressor gene (Klotho) and to shorten the length of telomeres, also diminishes the activity/expression of various membrane transporters in liver and kidneys, and that these changes can be ameliorated by treating animals with antioxidants resveratrol and melatonin. The extent and the intensity of aging-related changes, and the beneficial effects of antioxidants may be sex-related. To test this hypothesis, we propose various biochemical and cell- and molecular-biological studies of aging parameters and aging-dependent expression of various membrane transporters in the mammalian liver and kidneys using a rat model of experimental aging. Possible aging-related decline in the expression of these transporters may explain a higher incidence (women &gt; man) of drug interactions and toxicity in old people. The studies will define the underlying cellular mechanisms that contribute to generation of the aging-related pathophysiological conditions in the liver and kidneys, and will indicate possible ways of their amelioration. Positive results may point to remedies to be used for improving the health of elderly people.

Thus the main goal of the proposed project is to design and develop a non-thermal plasma reactor for the treatment of fruit juices and milk and optimize it to maximize the utilization of UV light and chemical species produced by plasma. To achieve this goal, we propose to address the following research objectives (R): R1 Develop and optimize a liquid-phase plasma reactor for treatment of fruit juices and milk. R2 Characterize the chemical and electrical properties of the liquid plasmas. R3 Evaluate the ability of the liquid-phase plasma to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms in suspensions of pure culture microorganisms and suspended in fruit juices and milk respectively. R4 Determine inactivation mechanism of the plasma treatments on microorganisms R5 Determine the effect of the plasma treatments on the physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory properties of juices and milk. The significance of the proposed research lies in the development of a novel plasma reactor as well as acquires new knowledge regarding the science behind the forthcoming plasma technology which can then be applied towards introducing and potentially replacing current processing technologies with plasma.

Phraseology is primarily a linguistic and culturally multi-layered discipline. The basic unit of phraseology is a phraseme (idiom). It consists of at least two components. Its characteristic is that it is not created in the process of speaking, but is included in discourse as an already known whole. Its main features are continuity of use, integrity and a solid structure, higher or lower degree of desemanticization, a colourful nature, expressiveness and connotative meaning. The project will primarily include theoretical work on analyzing Croatian phrasemes from various aspects. Furthermore, with the application of the method of contrastive analysis, structural, semantic, etymological, motivational and cultural similarities and differences between Croatian idioms and idioms of other Slavic and non-Slavic languages will be examined. We consider the latter to be extremely important because in this way Croatian idioms would be placed in the context of European idioms. The second part of the project proposal relates to phraseographical work. Phraseography is an area that deals with the issue of compiling phraseological dictionaries. The publication of several phraseological dictionaries is planned. Particularly important will be the two phraseological dictionaries which will be completely new in a conceptual sense (a trilingual dictionary of associations and a dictionary of gender-marked phrasemes). All dictionaries will be compiled according to the latest phraseographical methodology. In addition, we should mention the work on the updated edition of the Bibliography of Croatian phraseology.

Drago Marguš', 'Natural protected areas (NPAs) are a crucial part of nature conservation; many of them are tourist hotspots. Managers of NPAs have to balance environmental protection and tourism to maximize socio-economic benefits while avoiding irreparable environmental consequences. Since 1978, carrying capacity for tourists (CCT) has been recognized and legislated as a crucial tool in finding the balance. CCT is traditionally defined as the maximum number of people concurrently visiting an area without irreversibly damaging physical, economic, and/or socio-cultural environment. In practice, managers determine acceptable level of environmental damage, and then use adaptive management to achieve and maintain that damage level. We propose a more conservation-oriented approach of estimating CCT that maximizes nature protection. Although every tourist damages the environment, he/she also contributes to protection by providing financial assets. Without revenues from tourism, protection is significantly underfunded because meeting protection and educational goals of NPAs requires costly activities such as research, oversight, mitigation, and management. We propose to estimate CCT as the maximum number of visitors for which the marginal contribution to nature protection is positive, with the requirement that visitor satisfaction not be compromised. We will first formalize the estimation procedure, then identify tourist activities with their consequences on the environment and socio-economic parameters, develop general models for common factors affecting environmental quality of the NPAs, and integrate the models into a GIS-based framework. Finally, we will demonstrate the approach by estimating CCT for two very different protected areas crucial for Croatian tourism and the local economy: NP Krka and PP Telašćica. While the new way of estimating CCT will initiate a paradigm shift in NPA management, the two applications will contribute to Croatia''s nature conservation and economy.

A large amount of data regarding the 20 natural amino acids attributes will also be collected and analysed. We plan to propose new scales of amino-acid attributes that may be a basis for a multitude of future studies. In our experience, construction of good predictive models is not possible without using biophysical insights to propose appropriate molecular descriptors crucial for data-mining procedure and model building. These models should be based on newly developed molecular descriptors. Study of molecular descriptors will be important part of this project, their extremal properties (as indicators of the most active compounds), their complexity of calculation (since exhaustive search for optimal compounds can be computationally demanding) and their interrelationships. Dedicated algorithms for in-silico identification or proposal of structures with the desired properties will be built and verified through synthesis, characterization and testing of predicted antimicrobials. The activity, selectivity, conformation and mechanism of action of lead compounds will be explored using biophysical, biochemical and microbiological techniques.

Hence, some phytoplankton taxa can be used as water mass tracers (biotracers). We hypothesize that picophytoplanktonic prokaryote Prochlorococcus and nanophytoplanktonic eukaryotes coccolithophores: Emiliania huxleyi and/or Gephyrocapsa oceanic are such organisms, and can be used for tracing water masses in the Adriatic. Here, we propose interdisciplinary study where oceanography, taxonomy of phytoplankton and molecular recognition are combined to detect and follow water masses. Two winter cruises in the southern Adriatic will be conducted with station positions and sampling depths defined in situ. Water mass detection will be based on pre-defined physical characteristics; however, we also plan to use optical measurements in conjunction with the proposed sampling to develop an optical based criterion for definition of the targeted water masses. Phytoplankton community will be assessed using multiple tools to confirm the presence and to determine distribution, abundance and diversity of the proposed biotracers in sampled water masses. With the variability and trends of the Adriatic circulation as well as the water mass characteristics brought on by changing climate, we believe that proposed study is timely and needed as it is offering a holistic and integrated approach to oceanography of the Adriatic.

Bearing in mind the poor correlation between clinical symptoms and MRI findings there is a need for ancillary tools in the evaluation of brainstem pathology in MS. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of the brainstem evoked potentials score (bilateral AEP, bilateral ocular and cervical VEMP and bilateral tongue SSEP), the modified evoked potentials score (combination of brainstem evoked potentials score and VEP and SSEP of the median and tibial nerve) and standardized autonomic nervous system testing (Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS)) in the prediction of conversion from CIS to MS and accumulation of future disability. After 24 months of follow-up, this study could reveal the prognostic value of the brainstem EP score, modified EP score and CASS in patients with CIS on a number of parameters including: time until second relapse, accumulation of disability, accumulation of MRI lesions in the first 6 months, time to conversion from CIS to MS according to the 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria, number of relapses in the first 2 years of follow up. It can be presumed that the brainstem EP score and CASS score as direct and indirect measures of brainstem dysfunction, respectively will prove as reliable markers of future disability of CIS and MS patients.

Several forms are classified in clinical practice, depending on the main pathogenic mechanism: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used mouse model of RA and is still an indispensible tool to study the disease pathogenesis. Through the production of osteoresorptive mediators by immune cells, chronic inflammation in arthritis creates a microenvironment that promotes osteoresorption by osteoclasts (OC). OCs are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells arising from myeloid hematopoietic lineage. A number of systemic and local stimuli, such as hormones and cytokines/chemokines, promote osteoclastogenesis by enhancing OC differentiation, migration, activation, lifespan and function, but the exact mechanisms of how the inflammatory network works in vivo in the context of arthritis are largely unclear. Particularly, the human osteoclast progenitor (OCP) populations are not precisely defined and it is, as yet, unknown which critical mediators have the potential to activate OCPs and attract them to produce joint lesions. Using the mouse model of CIA and samples from arthritic patients we propose to elucidate differentiation sequence of early progenitors into mature OCs, shifts in the frequency of discrete OCP subpopulations and their migration patterns during arthritis. We plan to identify distinct OCP subpopulations in the bone marrow, periphery and joint lesions, their migratory and homing patterns, and their functional links to bone loss in arthritis. We expect to define the properties of inflammatory microenvironment in the regulation of OC trafficking, differentiation and activity in arthritis. A better characterization of arthritis-induced OCP subpopulations could offer the potential to design therapeutic approaches to control their migration and curtail their osteoresorptive potential.

The core methodology consists in conducting philosophical investigations that are aimed at offering practical recommendations and that are constrained by knowledge of the practical setting of Croatian mental health law and care. Two central philosophical issues appear to be relevant to the philosophical investigation and, thus, addressing them is the aim of the project. First, a significant part of the contemporary debate on the social response to antisocial personality disorder centers on this notion. Some have argued that this notion involves normative preconceptions against the liberties of certain individuals. Others have questioned the accuracy and scientific robustness of the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorders and its precision of related risk predictions. Second, the justification for choosing the appropriate treatment for people with antisocial personality disorder must also be a moral one. In particular, a relevant type of moral justification has to be grounded in principles that correlate psychological descriptions and explanations of a person’s behavior with his or her degree of responsibility. Similarly, compulsory treatment appears to be conditional upon a person’s diminished responsibility or capacity to act accordingly to a treatment decision, together with the existence of a risk to themselves or to others. The philosophical investigation of the project will be integrated with the contributions of a leading forensic psychiatrist in Croatia, a sociological qualitative analysis of the practices and challenges that are encountered by institutional representatives in the forensic department of the Rab psychiatric hospital and an historical investigation of the institutional response to antisocial personality disorder in the region in the period 1918-1980.

This platform was already recognized through the granting of an EU-FP6 project (2007-2010). The current project team is thus well equipped for the proposed work and exhibits a good balance between senior researchers, with excellent track records, and junior scientists with outstanding potential. The support of the project team by HrZZ is crucial for maintaining their competitiveness in the international scientific environment of computational life sciences.

The major questions asked are 1) What are the ecological baselines in Croatia in community structure? 2) How does anthropogenic activity (harvesting, coastal development) shift community structure from baseline? 3) How do marine protected areas maintain functional communities? 4) How is community structure changing over time? We will investigate these questions using innovative, non-destructive techniques for quantifying fish abundance and size distribution, and benthic habitat quality. These techniques include lure-assisted, underwater visual census which was originally developed in the Schultz laboratory; baited, underwater video; and DGPS-assisted, towed underwater video. EU policies require that non-destructive methods for assessment and monitoring replace destructive harvest-based methods currently in widespread use, and these methods are among the most scientifically supported non-destructive methods currently available. These methods will be used to quantify fish community structure and benthic habitat at all major MPAs and former MPAs in Croatia, to compare communities within MPAs to matched locations outside MPAs. Matched locations will be chosen to test for specific anthropogenic drivers of community structure, such as high fishing pressure, coastal development, marine tourism, aquaculture, and terrestrial runoff. These results will advance our basic understanding of coastal ecosystems, and will be crucial for satisfying Croatia''s responsibilities as an EU citizen in MPA construction, management, and monitoring of marine resources.

The basic idea underlying the project stems from an apparent disparity between the rather advanced extensions of the traditional linear finite-element principles to non-linear problems and the fact that the key finite-element concept – that of interpolation of the unknown functions – is surprisingly kept mostly constant, i.e. configuration-independent. Enabling the finite-element approximation to become configuration-dependent is motivated by the existing need to improve the current non-linear finite-element procedures, in particular for mechanical problems defined on non-linear manifolds. This principle is presented as the general concept providing viable novel development paradigm with obvious benefits for a wider class of mechanical problems. The configuration-dependent approximation to be designed shall obey the essential convergence requirements, with its extra flexibility (arising from the potential of the new approximation to vary with the configuration) employed to improve the solution in some clearly defined manner. In particular, during the design process, the following two basic principles will be consistently adhered to: (i) In the limiting case where the non-linear mechanical problem becomes linear, the configuration-dependent approximation sought must coincide with a known reference interpolation for linear analysis. (ii) In a general non-linear situation, the configuration-dependent approximation should preserve a set of selected mechanical or mathematical properties of equilibrium or motion defined beforehand. In this way, a variety of finite-elements for static and dynamic analysis will be derived.

This is evident from recent scenario-based approaches to study future trends and driving forces for rural Europe, both in academic and political discourse, on national and EU level (e.g. SCENAR 2020, EURURALIS etc.). On the other hand, although the majority of rural areas in Croatia face tremendous demographic and economic challenges, to our knowledge no scenario-based research has been done and only a few partial impact analyses have been conducted in recent Croatian agricultural policy. Therefore, the main objectives of the CRORURIS study are as follows: 1. to develop a conceptual framework for understanding recent change in rural Croatia; 2. to develop methodological framework for identifying predominant trends and key uncertainties, differentiating them geographically and projecting them forward using statistical modelling and Delphi method; 3. to construct alternative future scenarios and relate them to the context of rural Europe.

Repeated drug taking leads to neuroadaptations which over time affect neural networks and change behavior. One such change induced by drugs and commonly studied in lab animals is behavioral sensitization. Regulation of gene expression is one important mechanism by which drugs change the plasticity of the networks which regulate behavior. A group of transcriptional regulators of the molecular circadian clock have been identified to function as regulators of behavioral sensitization to cocaine in Drosophila. Subsequent studies in rodents proved the universality of those genes in mediating drug responses. The genetic pathways and molecular interactions through which circadian genes regulate drug responses has remained undefined. We hypothesize that new genes which interact with circadian genes in the regulation of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants can be identified in a genetic screen in Drosophila. This is a goal for which Drosophila is perfectly suited, because genetic screens aimed at defining new genes can be performed relatively easy, fast and cheap. Our first aim is to devise a high-throughput method for measuring behavioral sensitization in flies by modifying the existing method for measuring activity. Second, we will undertake a directed behavioral screen by pre-selecting candidates with reported molecular interaction with circadian genes. In the third aim we will use transgenic flies and other genetic tools to investigate neural mechanisms involved in behavioral sensitization. The proposed research is innovative and relevant for human health. New gene candidates isolated in this screen could easily be translated into mammalian research where they will help in further understanding of neuroplastic changes induced by psychostimulants.

Furthermore, OPs known as nerve agents (soman, sarin, tabun, VX) present a threat in terrorist attacks and conflicts, as was the case recently in Syria. The main targets of OP compounds are cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the essential enzyme in neurotransmission, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), its back-up enzyme. However, the antidotes currently in use, which act as reactivators of inhibited AChE, were empirically synthesized before the two enzyme’s crystal structures were resolved.

Besides its primary purpose, land administration system can and should also serve as a basis for land management.

Unfortunately, land administration systems are rarely able to fulfill such additional requirements, even in the developed countries. This project aims at finding what needs to be done in order to transform a traditional land administration system into a modern multipurpose land administration system (MLAS), which can efficiently support land management. Our hypothesis says that such a transformation can be done by improving two aspects of a LAS, its efficiency and its usability. Under efficiency we consider the ability of a LAS to update its data quickly whilst ensuring the consistency and correctness thereof. Within the project we will investigate options for outsourcing the preparation of transactions to private sector and the possibilities to more efficiently collect field data within the improved process of updating LAS data. Even more important that its efficiency, is the usability of a LAS. This is the second aspect that we try to improve within the project. Besides the mere registration of the land, MLAS must be able to efficiently support processes of land valuation, urban planning and various rearrangements aiming to increase agricultural productivity of the land. Within the project we will investigate which additional data needs to be collected, processed and stored within the LAS in order to enable efficient support to land management processes.

The main goal of this proposal is to develop novel polymer nanocomposites of extending photoactivity toward visible region under UV/VIS light irradiation and to introduce an innovative technology for water purification. The conducting polymers (CPs) are known as good hole conducting materials1 and are combined with semiconductor nanoparticles to produce a synergistic effect and complementary properties. Due to that Polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conducting polymers will be studied with metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO) nanoparticles to develop polymer nanocomposite photocatalysts (CPNPs) with enhanced photocatalytic properties. The optimal structure-properties relationships are crucial for efficient degradation of organic contaminants in water to convert them into harmless chemicals. Novel CPNPs will be applied in photocatalytic degradation of organic azo dyes (reactive red 45 and methyl orange) chosen as targeted wastewater pollutants. The utilization of waste material, fly ash, as a catalyst support will be explored to provide the additional environmental benefit. The proposed integral approach that will be used in the evaluation of the process efficiency will scrutinize any negative implications of CPNPs application. The project will contribute to the development and modernization of science and technology in Croatia, advancing toward the knowledge-based society within the European research area. Project includes a multidisciplinary effort, ranging from polymer science and technology, chemistry and environmental chemistry to electrochemical engineering, in order to meet challenging project tasks and propose an efficient photocatalytic polymer nanocomposite for sustainable water treatment technology. 1.

The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion. Antioxidant is a foreign substance that reacts with the oxidant faster than the components of the cell. An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favour of the oxidants is termed oxidative stress. Antioxidants act as free radical scavengers and therefore can lower the risk of numerous degenerative diseases by preventing damages caused by free radicals. Fruits and vegetables are the major sources of antioxidants in human diet. Several natural compounds found in food, such as polyphenols, vitamins A and E, and some carotenoids, have been found to show excellent antioxidant activity. Chlorophylls and their derivatives have also been reported to possess this activity. However, literature is still scarce regarding their antioxidant properties. It is known that the amount of each antioxidant in fruits, vegetables and their derivatives is strongly influenced by numerous factors such as agro-technical processes, environmental conditions, processing factors and storage conditions. Continuous monitoring of antioxidant capacity of plant-based foods through different phases, from cultivation to storage, is needed to maintain or even improve the beneficial properties of food. The goal of this project is to develop several cyclic multi-pulse voltammetric techniques for the characterization of natural antioxidants and to apply them in routine analysis of food quality. Experimental results will be explained by the comparison with the theoretical simulation of responses of various electrode mechanisms of independent and conjugated multiple redox centers.

One of the main topics of research in this project will be Diophantine m-tuples (sets with the property that the product of its any two distinct elements increased by 1 is a perfect square) and their generalizations. The first Diophantine quadruple {1,3,8,120} was found by Fermat. Baker and Davenport proved that Fermat''s set cannot be extended to a quintuple. This result motivated the famous conjecture that there does not exist a Diophantine quintuple. Dujella proved that there does not exist a Diophantine sextuple and that there are only finitely many Diophantine quintuples. Recently, Filipin, Fujita and Elsholtz significantly improved previously known upper bounds for the number of Diophantine quintuples, but the main conjecture still remains open. Various generalizations of Diophantine m-tuples will be studied, in particular, considering the problem in the rings of integers of number fields of small degree. Diophantine triples were used by Dujella in construction of high-rank elliptic curves over Q and Q(T) and new results in that direction are expected. In determining exactly the Mordell-Weil group of several elliptic curves over Q(T), an important tool is recent algorithm by Gusić and Tadić for finding rationals at which the specialization map is injective. We plan to improve and extend this algorithm for elliptic curves over K(T) for general number fields K. Members of the group will also work on Thue, Thue-Mahler and index forms equations, problems related to sums of divisors, polynomial root separation and applications of Diophantine approximations to cryptanalysis. The results of the research will be published in respectable journals and presented on international conferences.

In the 1990s, Vogan conjectured a strengthening of Parthasarathy''s Dirac inequality, which relates the cohomology of the Dirac operator to the infinitesimal character of the representation. This conjecture was proved in a joint paper with Huang . In further research, in part joint with various collaborators (Barbasch, Huang, Kang, Mehdi, Protsak, Renard, Somberg, Zhu) , we related Dirac cohomology to other kinds of cohomology, calculated it explicitly for many interesting representations, and studied algebraic Dirac induction, a construction of representations with given Dirac cohomology. The proposed project will continue this research in several directions: 1) the study of representations obtained by Dirac induction, in particular the discrete series representations (doctoral research of Ana Prlić). 2) applying Dirac cohomology to problems of restricting representations. Some instances of this have been studied with Huang-Zhu and with Somberg. 3) trying to strengthen the Dirac inequality, which should have implications for the study of unitary representations. Some preliminary work on the convex hull conjecture of Salamanca-Vogan has been done with Renard. 4) calculating the Dirac cohomology of unipotent representations. Some cases of this have been obtained jointly with Barbasch. This could lead to better understanding of characters of unipotent representations, which is related to the Assem conjecture.

Hypovirulence is the most efficient way to successfully control chestnut blight in Europe, but unfortunately the spread of CHV-1 is limited by the fungal diversity and its sexual reproduction. This project aims at revealing individual and joint aspects of the dynamic three-lateral interaction between chestnut, its fungal pathogen and the pathogen-biocontrol agent-virus.

The RecA protein is a key component of recombinational systems in bacteria. Its homologs are also present in higher organisms including humans. RecA functions in the form of nucleoprotein filaments that are assembled on single-stranded DNA, and which catalyze pairing and strand exchange between two homologous DNA duplexes. In Escherichia coli, the RecBCD and RecFOR protein complexes mediate RecA filament assembly, and consequently, play an important role in recombination. We have recently discovered that some E. coli mutants recombine quite efficiently in the absence of both RecBCD and RecFOR complexes. This recombination is RecA-dependent suggesting the existence of an alternative RecA loading activity. The aim of the project is to genetically characterize this RecBCD- RecFOR-independent (RecBFI) recombination pathway, and gain insight into this novel mechanism of RecA filament assembly. Although RecA is crucial for efficient recombination in bacteria, the recA mutants of radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans display a significant residual ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Recent results from our group have shown that this RecA-independent repair is quite inaccurate leading to gross chromosome rearrangements. Our project is to identify the key genes/proteins involved in this RecA-independent repair, and to characterize, at the sequence level, gross genome rearrangements in D. radiodurans. Given that recombination is a fundamental process largely conserved during evolution, our research on bacteria may reveal molecular mechanisms that are applicable to eukaryotic recombination systems. Thus, the results of our project could be instructive for research on cancer and other human hereditary diseases related to defects in DNA recombination functions.

Unlike most of the other mutated proteins known to cause ALS by their toxic prion-like properties, optineurin is largely thought to cause disease by loss-of-function, arguing for its protective role. In vitro studies proposed that it regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell signaling, autophagy and vesicle trafficking, but their link to neurodegeneration is unknown. ALS is not an autonomous disease of selected neurons. Glial cells including microglia, are essential for neuroinflammation, which greatly shapes disease progression. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the exact role(s) whereby optineurin exerts neuroprotection, pinpoint the cell types in which it acts, and determine its putative effect(s) on the interactions between the cell types relevant for neurodegeneration. We aim to dissect these questions in a stepwise fashion by (1) assessing cell-intrinsic functions in neurons, microglia and macrophages, (2) addressing crosstalk in mix-and-match co-cultures and organotypic spinal cord slices, and (3) verifying these findings in mice. To this end, we have generated a novel disease-mimicking genetic mouse model of optineurin insufficiency. Analyzing the function of optineurin in primary cells and mice models is crucial to the success of this study, given that ubiquitin-binding proteins are prone to in vitro artifacts. Incomplete understanding of ALS pathogenesis is directly mirrored in almost complete inability to treat ALS patients: a single approved drug exerts only a small prolongation in survival.

Contrary to antigen binding properties which are defined by nucleotide sequence for its Fab part, effector functions of IgG are mostly regulated by Fc glycosylation, which is regulated by complex interplay of dozens of genes in the IgG glycosylation pathway and different environmental factors. Different clones of B lymphocytes have defined patterns of glycosylation, indicating temporal stability in the glycosylation pathway. DNA CpG methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification and is thus the most prominent candidate for “fixation” of the IgG glycosylation profile in different clones. Our past and current genome wide association studies (GWAS) are identifying complex genetic network which regulates IgG glycosylation. In this project we will use several complementary experimental approaches to identify genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms which regulate IgG glycosylation. IgG glycosylation is relevant in numerous diseases, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Several epigenetic drugs are already used to treat cancer, and many others are developing. Understanding of the role of the epigenetic regulation in IgG glycosylation will provide new targets for the development of new epigenetic drugs and new biomarkers for patient stratification.

The stochastic nature of electricity production from RES imposes new challenges for the EPS operation and control. A large share of undispatchable RES can lead to significant disturbances of EPS components. These disturbances need to be balanced out and the security of the system has to be preserved. If the resources for providing balancing energy and flexibility are limited, secure operation of the EPS will become highly expensive. Conventional generation units provide the necessary flexibility to maintain a continuous balance between supply and demand. The question is: are these conventional resources the most feasible way of providing system flexibility in the future low carbon systems? During the recent years, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have become an attractive way of transportation. While passive approach to their integration might cause problems to the system, active utilization of their flexibility might enable higher penetration of RES. A similar reasoning can be applied to the distributed generation, especially technologies with the potential of multi energy vector interaction (efficient electric heating, combined heat and power, battery storage etc.).

At the same time, the addition of the masonry wall to the frame tends to increase the base-shear response and reduce the drift capacity of the structure. The increase of lateral force and reduction of drift capacity leads to serious vulnerabilities unless proper proportioning is exercised. For frames with competent walls, the challenge for safe and economical design is to be able to take advantage of the stiffening but to make certain that the increase in lateral forces and reduction in drift capacity do not handicap performance. Available evidence has pointed out that shear strength of the confining column is the ''''Achiless''s heel'''' of the system.

The OLA project involved research material derived from a special survey carried out in 853 settlements, the result of which was an extremely rich dialectological registry. The material collected does not confirm the traditional view of the disintegration of the Proto-Slavic language, instead showing that the disintegration process of the Slavic whole was much more complex. This is seen in isoglosses that cut Slavic territory into the most highly differing directions. This is proof that particular Slavic groups in various historical periods found themselves in complex relationships amongst themselves and that were constantly changing for economic, political, or cultural reasons. Linguistic material for ALE was collected using a special survey carried out in a majority of European countries, including 15 Croatian survey points. The project also involves the etymological and onomasiological interpretation of linguistic material from all European survey points. This project of linguistic atlases provides world dialectology with organised data on the phonetic, phonological, morphological and lexical systems of a large number of languages and dialects, and enables the well-founded study of the linguistic development of European languages. Croatian material is presented and interpreted, and the linguistic relationships between data from the dialects researched is confirmed. Conclusions are drawn on the history and development of languages, on the relationships between them, and thus on the relationships of the Croatian language towards neighbouring and distant dialects. This will provide material for comparative genetic and typological research of linguistic systems in the Slavic and non-Slavic world. These synchronic and diachronic relationships will be presented in the OLA and ALE books and atlases in the form of maps and commentary.

However, the increased mineral content in the diet does not guarantee increased mineral status for consumers and consequently mineral malnutrition is one of the global health concerns. Phytic acid (PA) acts as antinutritive compound by binding mineral cations and forming mixed salts. PA is also the main storage molecule for phosphorus and it is essential for normal seed development and germination. Seed mineral and PA content varies widely among bean genotypes. In Croatia bean is traditionally grown in low input production systems. The production is based on landraces which are adapted to local environments and display high levels of morphological diversity. A broad variability is also expected in seed bioactive nutrient content as well as on genetic level. Through international collaboration on Phaseolus genomics, a lot of information has become available including genetic linkage maps, microsatellite databases and a massive number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sequences. In proposed project an integrated approach will be used to characterize bioactive nutrient variability and the inherent genetic diversity. In conjunction with a detailed data on bioactive nutrient content, a whole genome association mapping analysis will be carried out in order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to bioactive nutrient content. Success in bean breeding for higher quality relies on the availability of information on bioactive nutrient content and the knowledge of genetic bases of quality trait variability. The integration of fundamental (molecular genetics) and applied (plant nutrition, plant breeding) sciences will facilitate the management of traditional landraces as sources of bioactive nutrients in future breeding programs based on marker-assisted selection (MAS).

Studies on the rare inherited forms of PD caused by mutations in the aSyn gene have highlighted disturbed aSyn clearance through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) as a key mechanism leading to PD/LBD. Furthermore, several rare inherited disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal genes show parkinsonian-like phenotype and accumulation of aSyn, providing additional evidence for the role of lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. The goal of the project is to elucidate the involvement of lysosomal gene mutations and lysosomal dysfunction in the ethiology of PD/LBD. Using the next-generation sequencing and Haloplex-based protocol we will design LYSOGENE platform to anayze genetic mutations/variations in the ALP genes that may lead to and predispose to PD/LBD. The identified ALP mutations will be further characterized in vitro in human neuronal cell lines using the knockdown and overexpression approaches. In particular, we will monitor how the identified mutations affect ALP function, accumulation and aggregation of aSyn, as well as neurotoxicity. Finally, we will validate our mechanistic findings in a biologically relevant model of human dopaminergic neurons derived from the PD/LBD patient’s fibroblasts using the induced pluripotent stem cell technology. Through these studies we will identify genetic variations/mutations in the ALP genes that cause or contribute to PD/LBD.

Many studies tried to unravel genetic contribution to HT development in the past few decades but with low success. The breakthrough of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) tremendously increased the rate of detecting novel associations. However, HT has been unrepresented in the GWAS mostly because of the lack of large cohorts of HT patients and the performance of such study is a matter of urgency. We plan to recruit 500 HT patients and to create a DNA/serum/plasma biobank of deeply phenotyped HT patients that will serve as a powerful resource for current and future investigations. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants underlying HT by performing the first GWAS focusing on HT exclusively. We will use newly recruited HT patients and 500 existing controls (from the “10,000 Dalmatians” study) in case-control GWAS and validate observed associations in an independent replication cohort. To further help in elucidating genetic contribution to HT we will perform pathway analysis and gene-interaction analysis using variety of environmental factors and medical records that will be collected from HT patients. We will also perform deep phenotype characterisation of HT patients that may provide additional clues about HT aetiology. This is timely planned study that aims to generate new knowledge that will advance our understanding of the genetic basis and underlying biological mechanisms of HT.

Following the increasing awareness of the environmental and human health concerns of shipping, legislative actions have been taken on global and national levels making mandatory (from January 1st 2013) that new ships over 400 gross tonnage, to comply with the regulations, should have emissions of CO2 under limiting value. Technological enhancement to ships like improved hull designs as well as improvement in power and propulsion systems could potentially reduce CO2 emission up to 35 %. These measures could effectively be combined with several other operational measures, such as weather routing and voyage planning, in order to ensure that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from ships are minimized on every voyage.

The analyses will encompass social practices in different domains of life, symbolic system (focusing on language) and the use of artifacts, or material life.

HCV productively infects hepatocytes to impart liver inflammation and progressive tissue damage leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. These processes underlie liver dysfunction and are thought to drive the onset of liver cancer. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which HCV confers hepatic inflammation are not defined. Now, there is growing evidence that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and Kupffer cells (KC), may play key roles in regulating immune responses and facilitating tolerance induction. These cells are playing a pivotal role in blood-borne virus clearance (&gt;90%), leaving only a small fraction of infectious virus that escapes clearance in a manner peculiar to each individual pathogen. The biology of HCV, specifically regarding non-parenchymal liver cells, has been largely neglected. LSEC account for the 20% and KC for 15% of the hepatic cells, and are a unique organ-resident cell population with diverse functions, including degradation of bacterial by-products, antigen presentation and induction of tolerance. The hypothesis of the research is that HCV infection reprograms cellular gene expression of LSEC and KC, which results in the modulation of the inflammatory responses. Applying the infectomics approach, we plan to perform a series of next-generation sequencing experiments on LSEC and KC isolated and purified from healthy, mild and severe chronic hepatitis C liver biopsies. This will allow us to detect expression changes related with disease progression. Selected candidate genes will be comprehensively studied in in vitro systems in order to elucidate their role in modulation of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses.

A common denominator for both aspects are the methods used to study them: social interaction can be descibed and simulated using agent-based models (ABM social science perspective) whilst distributed AI is commonly modelled in terms of multi-agent systems (MAS computer science perspective). The important question to ask in both perspectives is how do agents organize in order to perform their tasks and reach their objectives? Herein we will employ a combined empirical and theoretical approach towards finding the answer to this question. From the empirical side, we shall study the human behaviour on a number of venues across various gaming servers in order to find most suitable structures, cultures, processes, strategies and dynamics employed by most successful player communities. From the theoretical side, we shall test a multitude of organizational architectures from organization theory in various MMORPG settings, and compare them with methods found in empirical research. Our research is therefore aimed towards enriching the organizational design methods for the development of MMORPG to foster the development of self-organizing and adaptable networks of large-scale multi-agent systems. With this in mind, our main goals are: 1) To identify and formalize adequate organizational design methods for developing LSMAS in MMORPGs. 2) To couple them with real-life and future scenarios from industry. 3) To provide open and accessible tools, which will allow for design, development, implementation, control, simulation and maintenance of LSMAS in MMORPG.

Our interest is in plasmas produced in vacuum, under low-pressure gas environment, at atmospheric air or on/within liquids. Discharges which we use range from electrodeless, single electrode to various designs of two electrode systems. Lasers we use are cw or pulsed nanosecond. In our research special care will be devoted to tailoring the electron energy distribution functions as a key factor influencing plasma content and features. This is usually done by changing macroscopic plasma parameters - gas pressure, electrical fields and geometry of discharges. In this project we shall combine laser produced plasmas with discharge plasmas to achieve that goal. To understand the complex nature of plasma or processes of plasma interaction with other matter phases (gases, liquids and solids) basic approach is to perform plasma diagnostics by various types of optical and laser spectroscopies. To interpret findings we study basic atomic collision processes in plasmas and structure and spectra of various complexes formed within plasma (dimers, radicals etc). Modeling of various processes within cold plasmas and laser produced plasmas is performed in addition. In various applications in which plasma treatment of matter is used there is a need for in situ monitoring of processes both in plasma and at interfaces and therefore both spatial and temporal spectral resolution of applied detection techniques are important.

The properties of such systems can be described only by taking into account collective phenomena governed by strong and competing interactions, often leading to frustrations. The subtle interplay of interactions is, in turn, a key ingredient for extraordinary complex phase diagrams exhibited by SCES. Even more interesting are regions of instabilities away from stable phases. The way a new phase emerges close to a phase boundary reveals hidden properties of the studied system. It is extremely important to understand how symmetry breaks in the transition itself and identify the space and time-scales relevant for the changes of order parameter within the transition. Sometimes an intermediate state emerges between two stable phases, bringing new physics to light. This project aims to study some of these new, mostly unexplored states that emerge between well explored stable phases in SCES, or as a consequence of some kind of frustration. In order to obtain a complete picture of new states of matter we will combine several advanced experimental methods: nuclear magnetic and quadrupolar resonance (NMR and NQR) as an atomic-scale, local probe, and nonlinear conductivity as a mesoscopic probe of electronic physics. We will be able to systematically study the many phases and transitions in SCES, provide answers to some currently burning questions, and significantly advance our knowledge about them. In particular, we will study charge order in novel superconductors, and spin liquid and spin nematic states in frustrated quantum spin systems.

Therefore, the quest for a self-consistent theory applicable for description of systems with lattice disorder is a fundamental issue. Despite the efforts put into investigation of vibrational excitations in disordered systems at low temperatures, the consensus about their physical origin is still lacking. This project aims to address the subject by fully exploiting the advantage of embedded paramagnetic centres through focusing on their relaxation behaviour, which bears the information about the local frustration of the environment. The energy exchange within the spin system and between the spin system and the lattice will be detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) as a function of disorder in the vicinity of the paramagnetic centre. This we can control by preparing the host matrix in the glassy, supercooled or crystalline state. We propose to investigate the specific molecular dynamics due to the presence of disorder in the system while switching the very same compound doped with paramagnetic centres from disordered to more ordered state, such as from glassy to crystalline state. Additionally, the microscopic picture of local disordered sites will be examined in other systems doped with paramagnetic centres such as various polymer matrices or hydrogen-bonded crystals. The origin of local disorder will be correlated with the influence of different numbers of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of paramagnetic site as well as with the degree of local spin frustration. We expect that this comparative study will enlighten the peculiarities of vibrational density of states of amorphous materials and contribute towards development of the unique model of low-temperature molecular dynamics of disordered systems in general.

The socialist citizen was first placed in a strongly Soviet-oriented society, but the situation very soon shifted towards a specific kind of Yugoslav self-management and market socialism.

Ions are very efficient in creating numerous ionizations on their path through the material by ejecting/exciting electrons (electron stopping) and in creating vacancies by recoiling the whole atoms (nuclei) from their lattice sites (nuclear stopping). Therefore, irradiation of materials with energetic ion beams is considered as a) an efficient tool to alter materials physical, chemical, electrical and optical properties and b) a sensitive probe that can be used to characterise materials using some of the Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) methods. Understanding of complicated dynamical processes that lead to structural modifications of materials requires the knowledge of experimental data related to kinematics of defects during and after irradiation. Therefore the goal of the present proposal is experimental study of the time evolution of radiation induced changes induced by energetic (MeV) ion beams and their characterization using the RBI Tandem Accelerator Facility. The focus will be on studying: (i) influence of electronic stopping and related nanostructuring of materials by ion track methodology; (ii) influence of nuclear stopping to radiation damage and amorphization in crystals, including crystalline and functional materials of interest for future fusion reactors; (iii) charge transport properties in crystalline materials, focusing on novel semiconductor materials for radiation detection. Experimental methodology relies mostly on the unique RBI dual-beam end station that will be used for ion beam irradiations and simultaneous characterization of induced changes using IBA methods like RBS and PIXE in channelling mode, ERDA, NRA and PIGE, as well as IBIC (Ion Beam Induced Charge).

They are key elements of human microcircuitry which molecular specificity and neuronal interaction between and inside columns needs to be determined in order to assess how human cerebral cortex processes information. The aim of this project is to study organization and molecular properties of microcircuitry in the human frontal cortex that is believed to have unique features being the biological substrate for the most complex cognitive functions. The emphasis is to use histo-molecular techniques to dissect connectivity at cellular level and to establish a experimental monkey model to study microcircuitry in collaboration with Brain Dynamic Institute Marseille (http://ins.medecine.univmed.fr/) and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig (http://www.eva.mpg.de/). This will enable formation of unique database providing structural, physiological, molecular and genetic fingerprint of identified neurons as well as their connectivity within the entire cortical network in primates. Such database will be extremely valuable to create a simulation model of the human brain and to understand neuronal network alterations in various brain disorders. Studying cortical circuitry in the human is in the focus of current neuroscience research.

A practical objective of the proposed research project is to build an optimal economic growth/cycle model for Croatia using Advanced Growth Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm (AGSIFAL) that we plan to build. In order to do so, an algorithm (selected from the best of artificial neural network model, structural econometric model, dynamic general equilibrium model, nonlinear econometric model, golden triangle model) for cycle/growth sequencing and forecasting will be developed. Sequencing of the economic growth on a international scale (119 countries) will be performed using business cycle tracer methods and novel golden triangle model developed by Škare (2010). For this purpose, advanced cycle/growth algorithm will be created. Using individual country data as primer, we plan to isolate growth determinants using three dimensional golden triangle model and spectral analysis techniques. Output, inflation and employment form the three dimension of the cycle/growth triangle that will be used for sequencing growth. After a growth sequencing is finished, a best forecasting algorithm is built from the derived growth sequencing bases. Pairing isolated growth determinants help us to rebuild a growth sequence. Using different algorithm models, reconstructed economic growth series is compared to the actual growth series (observed data). Algorithm resulting in the smallest forecast error (RMSE) is selected as optimal to explain economic growth and predict business cycles.

Integrins are cell surface molecules that mediate sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion, and therefore represent a suitable target for therapy. This proposal investigates the molecular mechanism behind knockdown of integrins alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 using integrin subunit specific siRNAs (beta 3, beta 5, beta 6, alpha v, alpha 3, alpha 4 or alpha 5) and the ability of such a treatment to sensitise TNBC and melanoma cell lines to anticancer drugs paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. Our next goal is to identify how specific integrin knockdown influences cell migration and invasion. The focal adhesions (FA) are sites of attachment between cells and extracellular matrix which may mediate differential cell responses by variation of FA protein composition. Therefore, the FA protein composition will be investigated before and upon integrin silencing using proteomics methodology. We will monitor formation and temporal evolution of FA in living cells during spreading or migration using reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM). On the basis of these data, several signalling pathways will be proposed and their involvement in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion will be experimentally verified. Our data will contribute to the knowledge on integrin signalling pathways, structure and function of focal adhesions.

The evidence has been accumulated indicating the role of PVR and its receptors in immune surveillance including the control of viral infections, tumors, as well as in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Of note is that PVR is constitutively expressed on the majority of somatic cells, while its receptors are expressed on the majority of lymphocyte population. In many respects the interaction of PVR with its paired set of inhibitory and activating receptors resemble the interaction of paired co-stimulatory immune cell receptors and their cellular ligands (B7/CD28/CTLA-4). These co-stimulatory molecules have been the subject of intensive studies that resulted in immunoregulatory pharmaceutical agents for use in humans. The studies proposed here are based on the finding that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) affects the surface expression of PVR (Nat Immunol. 2005) and on our preliminary results indicating that mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) also downregulates mouse PVR. Thus, we first focused on the identification of MCMV gene(s) (proteins) involved in the PVR regulation, but also on the consequence of this viral regulation on antiviral immune response in vivo. To that aim we will generate MCMV mutants lacking viral regulators and test their in vivo susceptibility to components of innate and acquired immune response. We expect that the results obtained will further broaden the knowledge of PVR regulation and its significance in immune control, which will eventually help to translate this knowledge to developing new immunotherapeutic tools. Namely, one aim of this project is to engineer antibody specific for human PVR in order to be used as a tool in targeted tumor therapy. This idea is based on the fact that many tumors over-express PVR, which could be used in antibody mediated uptake of anti-tumor compounds.

Understanding dynamic traffic scenes is especially interesting due to exciting applications in the fields of smart vehicles (driver assistance, autonomous cars) and intelligent transportation systems (road safety inspection, adaptive traffic control). Nevertheless, many of these applications are out of reach since the computers are still unable to match human perception. We believe that this gap would be reduced by improving our understanding of scalable detection of multiple object classes in dynamic scenes. The task of object detection is to localize objects of interest in input images. We address detection in the most general case where the objects of interest exhibit large appearance variation. In this case the problem is often referred to as multi-class object detection. Our proposal focuses on dynamic traffic scenes acquired by a calibrated stereo rig from the driver''s perspective. We propose to develop detection approaches which would combine estimated camera motion and scene structure with learned appearance features, and to experimentally compare them with the state of the art.

A special attention will be directed toward the mathematical modeling of arterial growth and remodeling, which could help physicians to track certain cardiovascular diseases and predict their development. For modeling of engineering materials, a new micro-macro numerical procedure based on the second-order computational homogenization approach employing nonlocal continuum theory will be proposed. Both finite element and meshless spatial discretization will be applied. The damage evaluation at the microlevel which may lead to macroscopic fracture will be modeled. Here the damage evaluation law based on the computational averaging procedure will be used and the modeling at atomistic scale will be performed in the very narrow domain of localization. In the atomistic modeling using molecular dynamics, a special attention will be directed to the coupling of atomistic domain with the discretized continuum domain. An approach inspired by the quasicontinuum and bridging domain will be proposed. All results of the research will be tested by the modeling deformation responses of realistic materials.

We expect preparation of new, applicative materials with exceptional properties, observation of unusual effects caused by specific structure, and preparation of efficient thin-film coatings for conversion and storage of Sun energy.

For that reason the main objective is to preserve the quality of all available sources of drinking water. Among all the threats to water in nature, leachate landfills are most dangerous because of their complex chemical composition and continuous uncontrolled pollution of groundwater. Processes and methods of preventing the spread of pollution into groundwater and leachate treatment are a challenge for many researchers. This proposal should be a contribution to the landfill leachate treatment using natural zeolite as a reactive barrier. This material is available in nature, environmentally compatible, thermally and chemically stable, and possesses adsorption and ion exchange properties. Depending of the surface charge, zeolites can uptake organic and inorganic positive and negative species. The desired surface charge can be achieved by chemical modification using different methods at a controlled pH value. Modified zeolites should have significantly higher removal capacities and selectivity towards pollutants contained in the landfill leachate. These wastewaters are highly concentrated, have the most complex possible composition, contain low biodegradable organic matter (halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols), inorganic ions (Cl-, NH4+, SO42-,NO3-, NO2-,PO43-), and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Mn). Many of these components have shown excellent removal from modal solutions onto zeolite; therefore investigations will start with batch studies, continue in lab-scale fixed bed columns, and finally in scale-up and multi stage columns filled with different modified zeolites. The multi stage column performance should be carried out with real leachate collected from the regulated landfills in the Dalmatian region.

Since there is a crisis in the field of major scientific concepts, man tries to look for answers in a new mythology, which is visible in all forms of cultural research (literary text, visual arts, film, discourse of advertising). This is why this project proposal offers launching of a new type of research into neomythologism. The focus of the proposed research is based on the corpus of Russian and other Slavic literatures, including Croatian, in theatre, visual arts, film culture and contemporary media in order to study and define the elements of neomythologizing, especially those of the myths of everyday life (the myth of youth, the myth of the end of the world, the myth of the family, the myth of a healthy diet). Collection of materials, preparation works, workshops and conferences about the myths of everyday life shall take into account all aspects of this challenging topic in order to research this phenomenon, as well as the concept of the mythical in different aspects of Slavic cultures which are historically interconnected with a common mythology.

Therefore, there is a necessity for developing novel molecular approaches to treat this disease. Unlike other tumors, in melanoma p53 is relatively rarely mutated. However, overexpressed p53 fails to function as a tumor suppressor and tumor cells continue to proliferate and spread. This suggests that regulation of p53 activity depends on the interplay between p53 and its binding partners. Based on current state of knowledge, we hypothesize that p53 function in malignant melanoma might be altered through the interactions with p53 small molecular weight and p73 isoforms, nm23/NDPK and Gli families of proteins. Thus we will search for p53 protein binding partners in melanoma. The interactions identified by mass spectrometry will be further confirmed using microarray-based approaches and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. Furthermore, the expression profile of genes/proteins of interest in panel of melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue samples will be investigated. The potential impact of the identified p53 interacting partners on its transcriptional activity and the stimulation of apoptosis will be determined. The depletion of partners using siRNA technology would confirm the involvement of selected proteins on p53 activity. The subcellular localization of the proteins in complex will be revealed by advanced fluorescent microscopy methods on state-of-the-art instrumentation what would give us the insight on dynamics of their interactions.

Mechanisms of the solid-state processes cannot be interpreted using the established concepts of reaction mechanisms because the phase change plays the crucial role in determining reaction kinetics and the structure of the products. Until now, papers published in this field represent mostly kinetics of phase transformations and descriptions of kinetic data by various mathematical models. As a result, the relationship between such a macroscopic approach and structural changes on the molecular level is still poorly understood. Knowledge about the principles of solid-state reactions is of broad interest, and especially useful to chemists who use solvent-free synthetic methods.

As a starting point of our investigations of organic reaction mechanisms in the solution, we will finish development of our new cluster-continuum solvation model. It will provide us with the most important solute-solvent molecules clusters, allowing the realistic estimates of standard Gibbs energies of involved species and thus prediction of kinetic and thermodynamic data for the examined reactions.

Low concentrations corresponding to real-life exposures will be evaluated based on residential exposure levels, occupational exposure limits, acceptable daily intakes, and reference doses in appropriate cell lines and animal models. The malsegregation of chromosomes (X, Y, 9), integrity of gatekeeping genes (TP53, c-Myc), and protein structures (cytoskeleton components) will be studied within the transplacental genotoxic evaluation of selected pesticide groups. Among these, some are suspected to be endocrine disruptors. Potential effects on sex hormone levels will be assessed in neonatal rats and transfer via mother’s milk in pubertal rats. Oxidative stress will be estimated by measuring lipid peroxidation and activity of antioxidative enzymes in vitro and in vivo. We will study the processes affecting the distribution of pesticides in water/soil systems as well as the genotoxicity of their residues in soil and water. Results for low levels of pollutant exposure will serve to significantly extend the knowledge on their genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, sex endocrine disruption, mechanisms of oxidative stress, and distribution in the environment. Also, they will be used as a base for amending and adopting the Croatian National Action Plan for sustainable use of pesticides in accordance with demands postulated in Directive 2009/128/EC and the EU Thematic Strategy for Pesticides.

Graphene can withstand rather large elastic deformation and it appears that within the elastic response there is a range of different modifications in graphene’s electronic structure. This is a basis of what is called “strain engineering”. Recent theoretical calculations suggest that uniaxial strain or shear deformations can induce opening of the electron band gap, anisotropic modification of the Fermi velocity, spin-orbit interaction and consequently alter the transport properties. However, there is still no consensus on the mechanical conditions required to obtain a particular electronic modification. In this project we propose a systematic study of structural and electronic properties of periodically rippled graphene. We have already demonstrated that graphene conforms to the stepped (vicinal) iridium surface – Ir(332) creating periodic structure at nanometer scale. It is aim of this project to experimentally explore the dependence of the electronic structure of graphene with respect to periodicity of the graphene corrugation, orientation of the graphene with respect to the shear deformation (zig-zag with respect to armchair direction). By intercalation of different elements we will alter the graphene substrate interaction with the aim to control the structure of the underlying surface and consequently valence band structure of graphene. We shall investigate structural properties of graphene on Ir(332) by Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The focus in the investigation of electronic properties will be on the ARPES study of anisotropic distortion of the Dirac cone, relation with the direction of the graphene modulation, spin-orbit interaction and on the possibility to induce electron band gap.

A prerequisite for this progress is the complete understanding of the Standard model (SM) predictions. One of the triumphs of SM physics has been the extent to which QCD successfully describes strong interaction processes observed at colliders. More accurate QCD calculations are nowadays essential in understanding the enormous amount of available high-precision data, particularly since new physics effects are obscured by standard QCD processes. Our focus in that area will be to improve the description of hard exclusive processes by including higher-order contributions and by further developing the corresponding methods for automatic QCD calculations. Furthermore, we plan to do precision studies of top-quark production and decay observables which provide a unique view to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, important for understanding of particle mass generation. In the top-quark decay the information about its spin polarization imprinted by the production process is preserved, and can be calculated and measured in angular distributions of decay products providing other way to search for deviations from the SM expectations. Regarding new physics, the fact that neutrinos have a mass already requires an extension of the SM and calls for an understanding of the origin of neutrino masses. The seesaw mechanism, included in a theory as the one where left-right symmetry (parity) is restored at accessible LHC energies, stands out as a prominent theoretical candidate, and this theory links the origin of neutrino masses to new interactions at high energies and to the restoration of parity. A phenomenological investigation of these predictions is thus compelling and timely.

Aberrant P signaling has been associated with reproductive conditions, cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular defects, and neurological defects. In humans and mice the physiological effects of P are mediated by two intracellular receptors, termed PR-A and PR-B, expressed in subset of cells in target tissues. PR-A and PR-B isoforms are transcribed from a single gene by alternative promoter usage. PR-A (94 kD) isoform differ from PR-B (120 kD) by lacking 164 amino acids at the N terminus . Analyses to date have shown that PR-A and PR-B mediate mostly distinct but partially overlapping reproductive tissue selective physiological responses to P. The overall objective of this research is to establish the selective physiological roles of each of the individual PR isoforms in their natural physiological context. For this research we will use a genetically modified mouse in which gene targeting was used to knockout expression of either the PR-A or PR-B isoform in mice. The specific aims of this application are as follows: 1. To examine the isoform-selective molecular mechanisms by which PR-A and PR-B differentially regulate uterine epithelial proliferation, uterine receptivity and stromal decidualization. 2. To examine the selective contributions of the PR-A and PR-B isoforms to the P dependent immunomodulatory activity during early pregnancy. 3. To identify progesterone-regulated genes in musculoskeletal tissue using a genetically altered mouse models lacking progesterone receptors. 4. To determine whether differential signaling pathways of PR isoforms are conserved from rodent to human.

The field of socio-behavioural research on SEM has been marred by inability to distinguish between associations and causal links. The only available European panel study followed Dutch youth for only 12 months. To enable a more robust assessment of the links between SEM use and sexual socialization, health, and intimacy we propose to set up a 3-year panel sample with over 1,000 high-school students.

This social transformation was enhanced by Romans. Trade of ceramic objects is one of the main starting points for understanding the history of the Roman economy and society. For such scientific research it is necessary to establish a project using archaeometric analysis and archaeological research and a database of ceramics. Landscape archaeology methods such as field surveys, GIS, sampling patterns and statistical analysis will be used to analyse and interpret the wealth of data. RED project will include the development of an online database of documentary, archaeological material and archaeometric samples.

The breed is black in color, resistant and convenient for keeping in extensive and half-extensive conditions.

Recently, the traditionally produced food came into the focus which led to more often use of geographical indications (protected designation of origin-PDO, protected geographical indication-PGI and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed-TSG) as the valuable rural development strategy. Since Black Slavonian pig is a late maturing breed characterized by low lean meat percentage, meat processors tend to use the meat of modern pig breeds in production of traditional products. Therefore there is a need for scientifically developed methods in order to trace the origin of materials used in such production. First of all, molecular identification of breed will be performed by the use of MC1R gene and 18 microsatelite primers . Since the genotype, age and sex are possible sources of variation of the meat quality traits in pigs, the objective of proposed research is to determine the optimal time for slaughter with respect to these factors. The genetic influence on meat quality traits is nowadays well described by the use of molecular markers by which many of the candidate genes were discovered. In proposed research a special interest will be placed at some of them such as IGF2, MC4R, H-FABP3 and LEPR. The investigation of sensory traits and chemical analysis of meat and meat products will help to determine the typical physico-chemical characteristics and sensory profile of autochthonic Slavonian dry-cured meat products and fresh meat originated from Black Slavonian Pig meat.

The two cases which exhibit most concerns are the collision between ships and hard grounding on seabed.

Thus, the goals of this research stem from the above stand point, and include: • Establish development policies for Croatia based on sustainable use of natural resources • Show how change of age structure in Croatia affects fiscal sustainability and short and long run economic development • Explore how three way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and movement of factors of production affect international, regional and urban development • Analyze structure of Croatian economy suitable for sustainable and deeper integration into the EU • Define integrative policies which lead to sustainable development of Croatian economy For achieving above mentioned goals, the project team is separated into four equally contributing groups and is structured as follows: 1. Sustainability of economic development within the context of scarce natural resources. 2. Sustainability of public sector economics and the labor market in the context of demographic changes in Croatia. 3.

The primary challenge, in wider adoption of WDM-PON, lies in the development of sufficiently low cost technology to be used at the users’ premises. Self-seeded WDM-PON has been actively investigated in recent years as potentially the lowest cost solution for next-generation access networks. The primary attraction of this architecture is its simplicity, lower power consumption, and cost advantage. Similar principles can be applied to multiplexing and interrogation systems for optical sensors and our aim is to develop, analyze and demonstrate sustainable all-optical infrastructure based on extended cavity resonators able to provide physical layer for both, access communication and sensor networks. At University of Zagreb we invented an optical component, the modulation-averaging reflector, which reduces the penalty due to modulation of the seeding light and depolarizes the light oscillating in the cavity thereby stabilizing the extended resonator. This was the first step towards a future-proof optical access technology. Within this project we will fully develop and characterize systems based on extended cavity resonators with modulation averaging reflectors. We will also explore the use of modulation averaging concept in a novel communication optical source architecture based on wavelength re-use. Finally, the concept of extended cavity resonators will also be implemented in non-communication applications such as new optical sensor schemes.

In order to do that we have to study different forms of self-generating mechanisms by which the autonomous mind (AM) is brought about. The autonomous then stays roughly for the mental ''infrastructure'' that operates by generating impulses for action, mental and motor, without having to process them in consciousness. We will consider this phenomenon as primary in relation to consciousness that emerges rather late in the chain of mental processing. One of the basic premisses that builds the ground for our investigation is the assumption that mental states are heavily underdetermined by sensory data. To claim this is to enter the dispute with the current mainstream (particularly within the consciousness studies) that sees mental phenomena (specifically consciousness) firmly rooted in sensation, on the ne hand; it also means a conflict with the canon of intellectualism, the long-lasting impact of which (following Descartes) resulted in consciousness- and thought-centeredness with which we are faced and which we want to critically examine, on the other hand.

We will study: (1) phosphorylation and dimerization of receptors and the consequences of this events on mitophagy progression; (2)factors that regulate tight connection of apoptosis and mitophagy; (3)potential interplay between mitophagy receptors and other mitophagy-related proteins, like E3-ligase Parkin and kinase PINK1; (4)the effects of mitophagy on cancer development. To reach our goals we will use established methodology in our laboratories including protein identification and interaction techniques (Western blot, IP, GST-pull down, RNAi), immunofluorescent microscopy, mass spectrometry, ITC and NMR. All experiments will be performed using cultured cells. This project proposal has a high capacity to generate very interesting data with high possibility for publications in top scientific journals. Fundamentally, generated data will help to understand the physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cancer and allow us to manipulate mitophagy to fight diseases.

Growing stock in narrow-leafed ash forests reaches 4,3 million m3, binding 11,8 million tons of carbon dioxide acting as an important carbon sink depository. Natural and artificial regeneration of ash stands is under direct impact of numerous biotic and abiotic factors, many of which seriously hamper the viability of ash. Insect pests, pathogenic fungi, large game ungulates and ruminantes and small rodent populations play dominant role in the complex processes of tree decline and stand deterioration. Additionally, in the course of recent Europe-wide dramatic spread of newly identified lethal disease on ashes (Chalara fraxinea), introduction of a highly damaging Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) on the eastern borders of Europe, and increased frequency of climatic extremes urge the need to intensify the research of this phenomena. Through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, in the course of 4 years, the proposed research project targets on several critical aspects of aforementioned biotic detrimental factors analyzing them in the given area and time and aiming to provide a multitude of new details on the mechanisms of their impact. Modern methodological approach covers the following major research topics: presence, local impact and ash disease spread and host resistance tests; additive impact of ash defoliators in the course of recent decline and possibility to manage their populations via entomopathogenic organisms; the impact of small rodents on tree regeneration, acting also as an important human diseases reservoir; negative impact of large game in ash regeneration; geospatial and temporal analysis of major biotic influences in given forest communities.

Namely, BCS offer direct assessment of the otherwise intangible factors such as economic agents’ perceptions and expectations. They measure the agents’ willingness to consume/invest/save, as opposed to their ability to do the same. Hence these psychological factors are crucial to understand the underlying market forces and agents’ behavior. The project goals are to: - Discern whether the non-rationality of consumers’ inflation expectations stems from the true inability of consumers to anticipate price changes, or did the researchers induce it themselves by falsely assuming that the distribution of BCS responses is normal. - Question whether the poor forecasting accuracy of BCS leading indicators can be improved through obtaining the optimal weights by (non)linear optimization. - Compose an optimism indicator based on BCS responses and determine the nature of its relationship with the stock market returns. Nonlinear time series analysis will be employed to test if the stock market reacts asymmetrically to positive/negative shocks in the economic sentiment. - Estimate the consumers’ willingness to buy realty and econometrically model its relationship with actual real estate prices. - Assess the value of BCS responses on households’ financial distress by correlating them to the common measures of poverty. - Employ the BCS data on managers’ perceptions to construct a liquidity indicator for the Croatian economy. The first 5 goals will be fulfilled by analyzing the proposed issues in EU countries, which will improve the general understanding of the role of sentiment in economic decision-making.

Several recent studies pointed to their role in the regulation of different cellular processes in eukaryotes, yet in many instances direct mechanistic roles remain elusive. Our recent study provided genetic, metabolic and biochemical evidence that synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates through activation of Plc1 and Kcs1 play an important role in the signalling response required for cell cycle progression after mating pheromone arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Banfic et al.

This is a proposal that aims to define the mechanism of pyrophosphates-mediated regulation of cell cycle progression. We will use a set of yeasts deletion mutants to define a) the particular pyrophosphate responsible for S phase-associated effects, b) to test for the possibility that inositol pyrophosphates generated during S phase progression regulate telomere length, c) to test the possibility that the increase in the level of pyrophosphates in alpha-factor synchronized cells is associated with an increase in pyrophosphorylation of the proteins and/or protein expression or modification, and d) to determine the changes in metabolism in alpha-factor synchronized cells and to correlate them with the changes in the level of inositol pyrophosphates.

We believe that the changes of structure and expression of the selected genes correlate with the phenotypic changes of tumor cells. EMT is a process very much involved in invasion and progression of tumors. Many oncogenic signaling pathways can induce EMT. The classical Wnt pathway has a particularly tight link with EMT and it has been shown that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin can induce EMT. Wnt pathway is one of the basic cellular pathways whose misregulation plays important roles in tumorigenesis and whose mediators of transcription are members of TCF/LEF family. Another important protein family is the Dishevelled considered to be the central hub of Wnt signaling since it interacts with Wnt receptors and recruits the multiprotein beta-catenin destruction complex. The experiments of the proposed research will use modern methods of molecular biology for the analyses of brain tumor samples of different malignancy grades. The genetic changes will be tracked by PCR/loss of heterozygosity, heteroduplex and Spreadex electorphoresis (Elchrom Scientific, Switzerland) methods. Expression of selected proteins will be studied by immunohistochemistry demonstrating their location in tumor cells. Besides its scientific value, results from the proposed project will have an application in medical diagnostics.

There is growing evidence that OSAS contributes to the initiation and progression of hypertension, heart failure, cardiac ischemia, stroke and cognitive decline. Chronic sympathetic activation resulting in elevated sympathetic nerve activity and cardio-respiratory sensitivity to hypoxia appears to be important. Still, the exact mechanisms underlying the link between OSA and cardiovascular and neurophysiologic disturbances are not completely known. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) in experimental animals can mimic periods of repeated apneas seen in OSAS patients. Exposure to repeated bouts of hypoxia in human leads to increased sympathetic activity, whilst intermittent hypoxia in experimental animals evokes increases in phrenic and sympathetic nerve activities. The proposed study will examine the role of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (e.g. serotonin and opioids) in evoking sympathetic long-term facilitation using anesthetized animal model of IH.

The materials'' parameters in existing US systems used in biomedicine and industry are determined at low excitation levels assuming linear physical principles and consistent thermodynamical conditions. This is different from real operating conditions where range of applied powers and types of excitation signals is various and very often far away from linear. The neglect of these nonlinearities in active and passive materials, used in the complete US system construction process, leads to the problem of the US systems’ efficiency factor in the nonlinear driving conditions. The construction of modular measurement system with included and modified interferometry and time of flight principle with added new measurement procedure is crucial for developing novel US systems with higher electroacoustic efficiency factors. The new method is based on tracking the resonant frequency changes of the nonlinear electro-mechanical-acoustical system for determination complex material parameters. The new modular measurement system will enable exposure of materials to the US fields with various driving conditions. Tracking the resonant frequency changes of excitated loading medium sample (active piezoceramic or passive construction elements or different types of loading mediums) is novel method for determination of material parameters when nonlinear effects appear in the loading mediums. As a result of more precise constructive material parameters determination, three prototypes of US systems with probes and electronic excitation circuits for applications in biomedicine and industry, with obtained higher electroacoustic efficiency factors will be developed, constructed and tested during this project.

NK cells are essential in early control of CMV infection. An evolutionary struggle between NK cells and CMVs can be inferred from a numerous viral mechanisms designed to compromise NK cell function. A deeper insight was gained by studying MCMV evasion of ‘missing-self’ mechanisms and host response to this immunoevasion, illustrated by several MCMV-specific NK cell activating receptors. The work on Ly49H receptor emphasized the selective pressure imposed on the virus to generate variants no longer recognized by this receptor. Another example can be seen from the function of viral m04 protein, which binds to newly synthesized MHC-I molecules and escorts them to the cell surface to engage inhibitory Ly49 receptors. However, while m04 prevents NK cell activation by escaping ‘missing-self’ recognition, several activating Ly49 receptors also depend on its presence for their own recognition of infected cells. Beside m04, another so far unidentified viral factor is required for turning on the activating Ly49 receptors. In addition to characterization of this new viral gene, the aim of this study is to elucidate the functional significance of MCMV-specific activating Ly49 receptors and their interaction with inhibitory counterparts during primary and latent infection. Ly49 receptors in mice are functional homologues of KIR receptors in humans. Recent studies also indicate a strong impact of HCMV on the repertoire and frequency of activating KIR-expressing NK cells, suggesting their specific response to this virus. Therefore, in addition to the MCMV genes involved in ligation of activating Ly49 receptors, here we also propose study aimed to characterize HCMV gene(s) involved in ligation of activating KIRs. We expect these studies to provide new data of groundbreaking potential in the field.

For most people the adolescence is the tipping point for career decision making. Last grade high-school students have to decide between further education on universities or entering the world of work and finding a job. To successfully overcome this important career transition period, adolescents have to become aware of their preferences and capabilities, to crystallize their career goals and to form their vocational identity. By implementing their vocational identity through engagement in their desired job or educational program, they should be able to achieve success and satisfactions in their careers, to fit in and adjust to their working environment and job demands, and to be motivated for their work and future advancement. The Adolescent Career Transition Model encompasses several career related behaviours, competences and traits that can influence positive career transition outcomes. We will assess approximately 1200 high school students at the beginning of the last grade of high-school (17-18 years) and follow their career development for the next 18 months. In three separate time points we will administer measures of career-related traits and social support, career self-guidance competencies, vocational development and career transition outcomes, through a secure online testing system that will be developed for this project.

Moreover, one of the objectives is to investigate news impact curve of different volatility models as well as to compare different types of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedascity models in terms of their ability to describe structural changes in returns and to explore if Markov regime switching GARCH models outperform uni-regime GARCH models in forecasting volatility when sudden switching occurs.

The second one combines panel methodology with GARCH models.

This project will investigate a possibility to design and operate a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell with ambient air without external humidification using water and heat produced inside the fuel cell. This may be accomplished with adequate temperature distribution along the cathode channel, which would require a specific design of the fuel cell in terms of spatially variable heat transfer rates, and corresponding control of the cooling subsystem. In order to determine whether the proposed concept would result in longer life of fuel cell, some basic understanding of causes of fuel cell degradation is needed, particularly related to water and heat management. Particularly, it is proposed to investigate heat transfer in nano-structured catalyst layer because inadequate heat removal from the electrochemical reaction sites may be one of the causes for fuel cell degradation. Other stressors will be studied as well, and procedures for accelerated durability testing will be established, in order to confirm that the proposed concept of water and heat management is beneficial to fuel cell durability. The proposed research is expected to improve understanding of water and heat transfer in PEM fuel cell, including the effects that dry conditions and inadequate heat removal from the catalyst sites may have on fuel cell durability.

Of importance are also mathematical objects being, in a generalised sense, accumulation points of weakly convergent sequences, such as defect measures or H-measures. The research will be directed towards improving the existing weak convergence methods, designing new mathematical objects for that purpose, as well as developing new methods, with particular attention paid to their applications to practical problems. Problems known as homogenisation are tied to properties of mixtures of materials, with important applications in optimal design. Problems related to evolutionary equations and their admissibility conditions mainly concern transport problems in free and porous media, where it is sometimes natural to include continuous time random walk variables in the model. Such problems sometimes also lead to fractional derivative equations. Some problems are related to hyperbolic conservation laws and the propagation and interaction of singularities. High-frequency waves corresponding to solutions of hyperbolic systems are governed by ODEs, allowing for final interpretation as particles. Particularly interesting are situations where the equation changes its type (like transonic fluid flow), motivating our interest in Friedrichs systems. Further results for semilinear systems could open a new approach to the Maxwell-Dirac system, with potential applications in quantum field theory. Practical computation of coefficients in specific applications is also important; as the unknown functions have the domain in multidimensional space, quite often more efficient numerical methods have to be developed.

The NA, identified as a Mediterranean''s climatic change „hotspot“, is expected to withstand environmental impacts that are considerably greater than in many other places worldwide. Such a uniquely dynamic system allows as to investigate the biological capacity and ecosystem elasticity in relation to these forcings. This project, at this state of knowledge, will be the first one that tries addressing the impact of the aforementioned anthropogenic drivers on the ecosystem behaviour (changes in water chemistry, metabolic activity and biodiversity). It will also advance the international state of the art in the following aspects: temporal resolution of the in situ acidification and phytoplankton physiology analysis, taxonomic resolution, combined taxonomic and metabolic analyses and molecular biodiversity. A buoy positioned at a point that integrates the most of the NA dynamics will serve as a hub for the continuous acquisition of the oceanographic and biological parameters. Together with the largest historical data set in the wider area and the most advanced approaches (in situ pH and phytoplankton physiology, taxonomy and analyses of metabolic activities), it will allow us an exhaustive insight in these interactions. At the end, this research will enable us to build scenarios of possible ecosystem reactions to predicted environmental changes in the NA and, in a wider sense, to all marine systems.
