We start from the observation that the scholarly discourses in Croatia have so far not sufficiently acknowledged the cultural complexity of the economic sphere, especially the seminal significance of histories of Britain and America in that regard. Our methodological point of departure is therefore the assertion that the economic sphere can be understood only in reference to the entirety of culture. We intend to explore the complexity of this totality as refracted through cultural histories of Britain and America, as a horizon necessary for understanding Croatian cultural history. Our intent is to investigate complex interrelations of the sophisticated Victorian variant of capitalism and its American mutations, in the 19th and the 20th centuries. This applies primarily to Cold-War America, when capitalism contrasted to socialism becomes a totalizing formula to regulate various economic and political structures, but also the sphere of culture where public vs private is defined. Thus caught in relation to socialism, capitalism is definitive to life in the former Yugoslavia as well; this then sediments into a difficult genealogy which burdens capitalism when, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it enters formerly socialist countries, now as a platform for understanding and regulating postsocialism. Our approach is anchored in the assumption that research based only in economy or political theory fails to shed light on the logic of capitalism. This defines our methodology: we maintain that a truly functional analysis of the impact of capitalism demands a confluence of literary history, film studies, psychoanalysis, philosophy, cultural theory and, especially, the knowledge specific to English and American Studies. 					 				|	|Philology|	|cultural history, economy, capitalism, Britain, America, Croatia|

It will enable numerous physicians to acquire the trunk surface (TS). TS symmetry is one of the key elements in diagnostic and evaluation of various treatments in patients with trunk deformities. Common radiographic evaluation methods are known to expose patients to a radiation and, besides, radiography is actually 2D representation of 3D problem which has been shown not to be directly related to the shape of the back. Thus, there has been a constant motivation among researchers at (inter)national level to develop an optimal methodology for 3D reconstruction of the back. Still, most of those developed systems are mainly directed to 3D reconstruction of the spine and calculation of the Cobb angle which is still regarded by many as the gold standard method to measure scoliotic deformity. Still, the Cobb angle alone cannot explain the whole of the surface deformity. Evidently, there is high need to investigate development of a 3D reconstruction system which will capture both back and front of the patient, i.e. the entire trunk surface. In turn it would enable a more thorough analysis of the patient’s deformity pattern, i.e. a second major goal during this project is to derive other parameters (not only Cobb angle) in order to quantify trunk deformities. In designing 3D system we underline that we plan to research the implementation of both passive and active stereovision strategies. Researching the implementation of combined best features from passive and active stereo for one concrete of 3D system aimed at TS reconstruction (scoliosis), would be a great contribution for potential other 3D applications. Degenerative diseases of spine represent a serious social problem in Croatia. More than 10% of population has frequent problems with it. Clearly, every research contribution for this matter would be an extremely valuable asset. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|3D reconstruction, structured light, passive stereo, scoliosis, degenerative disease, 3D spine shape|

The defining characteristics of CSC are self-renewal, propagation into heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells, and increased resistance to chemotherapy, thus, attacking the CSC should abolish a tumor's ability to recur or metastasize. Recently, a natural potassium ionophore salinomycin was identified as one of a few available CSC-selective substances, but the precise mechanism of its selectivity remains elusive. Based on hypothesis that the potassium transport is an important process of CSC biology, the objective of the proposed research is to understand fundamental processes of CSC-resistance to therapy and to discover novel compounds with ion homeostasis-modulating properties to selectively target CSC. Project methodology orchestrates research in three principle areas and their close interactions, covering synthesis and characterization of molecules (chemistry), assessment of their activity in biological models (biology, medicine) and computer-aided drug design (computational sciences). We’ll focus on salinomycin and a series of proprietary crown ether compounds, which will be optimized and developed. Their efficacy/selectivity and influence on drug transporters P-gp- and/or ABCG2-mediated efflux of chemoterapeutics will be assessed, as well as the toxicity and in vivo activity of the most promising compound. Deploying cutting-edge techniques in cell and molecular biology, bioimaging, molecular electrophysiology and transgenic cell lines (e.g. a unique CSC model - HMLEshEcad cells) we will strive to recognize novel biomarkers for identification and enrichment of CSC, related to abnormal potassium transport regulation that promote acquisition of CSC phenotype and/or influence their proliferation, death and migratory potential. The ultimate aim is to translate this knowledge into innovative mechanism-based therapeutic approaches. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|cancer stem cells, potassium transport, salinomycin, crown ethers, ion channels, ABC transporters, predictive QSAR modeling, drug discovery, therapy|

Robot’s performances during the surgical procedures are investigated within the previously conducted technological project, RONNA - Robotic Neurosurgical Navigation. Results of RONNA suggest that the benefits of using robots in the operating room are enormous, e.g. increased accuracy and repeatability of the surgical procedures, flexible and tremor free operations, etc. During the RONNA realisation, it is recognized that certain new cognitive robot skills yet need to be developed. The long-term vision of the proposed ACRON project as a multi-disciplinary research arises from the recognition that a paradigm shift in human-robot-environment interaction is needed. Currently, technology robustness is achieved by restricting the interaction space, so that the region and the nature of the interaction can be controlled by the system. In ACRON, the cognitive fulcrum will therefore move from sensed data to the robot contextual anticipation. ACRON will advance the research providing a uniform scientific framework for the study, development and implementation of cognitive concepts, providing the robot to function in ICT enabled ubiquitous environment that can be shared by different kinds of agents. ACRON will therefore bring the new context-aware medical robot capable to anticipate the most appropriate actions respecting the phase of the medical procedure and spatial positions of the staff and objects. We will investigate the relationship between people, robots and the shared environment where they interact and work together. By moving throughout the discretized working space and while achieving the current assignment, the medical robot will become able to avoid all-possible spatial collisions and make the appropriate context-based decisions. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|robotics, artificial intelligence, cognitive models, medicine, neuroscience|

We are talking about 42 poets. This project is thus a survey of everything that was written in the 17th century, in all three literary forms (Lyric, Narrative and Drama), excluding the writers that already have their own critical editions (Palmotić, Gleđević, Gundulić, Đurđević, Bunić). The project is substantial since it encompasses: a) collecting and comparison of manuscripts; b) transcribing the manuscripts; c) an accompanying study. This project is neither an anthology nor a chrestomathy, but it strives to collect in one place everything that a certain writer wrote, regardless of the literary value. 					 				|	|Philology|	|Croatian Literature, Dubrovnik, 17th Century, Critical edition, Tekstology|

Research results indicate the increased scope of workload and demands for new approaches to teaching, disharmony between teaching and research, increasing administrative duties, and the insistence on a stronger connection between the academic community and social environment. This project aims to determine how academics in Croatia assess the relevance of various competences, and how they assess, perceive and interpret possession of various competences that shape contemporary academic profession. It is expected that the research results in a proposal of the academic profession’ competence framework. In the research quantitative and qualitative methodological approach (survey and semi-structured interview) will be used. The survey consists of the competence framework elements which are to be evaluated by the participants in terms of the assessment of their (1) relevance and (2) possession. The interviews will explore the deeper perception of academics and challenging issues within the framework, and gain a ‘holistic’ (comprehensive, systemic, integrated) understanding of context, while capturing data on the participants perceptions ‘from the inside’. The final definition of an integrated competence framework which includes different dimensions of the academic profession is an original research contribution. Bearing in mind that the research of the academic profession is neglected in the national research discourse, the results of this study will also be a starting point for defining recommendations for (national) educational policies. This will particularly apply to profiling the academic profession in the context of recent strategic directions in Croatia, in accordance with the requirements of the international scientific community. 					 				|	|Pedagogy|	|higher education, academic profession, competence framework, academic roles, higher education policy|

As an installation research project it will help set up an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research group that would tackle all aspects of the language processing in adults and in the aging population. Clinical groups (patients with aphasias, dementias and dyslexia) will be included into the project; language breakdown in these clinical groups helps in the study of language processing in healthy adults and vice versa. It is generally assumed that the subtle changes in language processing in the aging population arise from the cognitive decay related to executive functions, not language per se. The decrease in the processing speed influences language processes that require fast execution or simultaneity. This results in a typical pattern of changes, different from the ones in clinical populations. Therefore, executive functions in these groups will be studied in order to build a comprehensive model of adult language processing. Theories of language processing (namely, Role and Reference Grammar - RRG) will be considered to define specific traces of language processing that assume fast execution or simultaneity and therefore should be the most vulnerable in aging population. These traces will be defined and described which will put Croatian into a cross-linguistic perspective in contemporary studies of linguistic aphasiology and provide coherent picture of age related changes in adult language system. 					 				|	|Logopedics|	|language processing, adult and elderly population, language disorders, executive functions, linguistic aphasiology|

The electrification of the transport equipment and the shift of the freight shipments from road to more efficient rail are some of the key elements for the overall increase of energy efficiency in transport and reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions. This project puts emphasis on development of advanced electric drives for traction vehicles for passenger and freight transport running on tracks. Traditional approach to the design of electric drives has an emphasis on components without insufficient insight into the interaction among them and thus it fails to deliver the optimal performance of the overall traction system. The main objective of this project is to enhance the general approach to design of electric drive systems for traction applications by utilizing a synergetic approach to component design accompanied with advanced control algorithms to maximize the system performance and efficiency and minimize the life cycle cost of the vehicle. This objective will be achieved through: (i) development of software tools for computer aided design of electric drive components for traction applications using multiphysics approach with consideration of component interaction with the rest of the system, (ii) development of different traction power converters topologies for evaluation of various modulation and control methods, (iii) development of software environment for dynamic simulation of traction system performance which couples complex nonlinear models of system components with the models of control algorithm and vehicle dynamics, (iv) development of the electric drive control system based on optimal control approach which ensures maximum efficiency of the system during entire drive cycle of the vehicle. The developed algorithms will be experimentally tested on the scaled model of the traction system. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|electric traction, electric drives, energy efficiency, optimization, life cycle cost, control of electric drives, power electronics, electric machines|

This objective is aimed to be resolved by implementing of the novel forest ecosystem assessment approach, applicable for the country scale, which incorporates: a) traditional in situ ecosystem survey (soil and vegetation), b) analysis of the functional state of the ecosystems by remote sensing, c) downscaling of the regional climatic models and d) coupling of scenario outputs with ecohydrological models on a site specific environmental settings. The core system on which AFORENSA activities will be build up, presents “Dynamical Geoinformation system of forest ecosystems in Croatia” (DYN-CROFOR), a technological project financed by the Ministry of Science and Education from 2003 to 2007. Aforensa is aiming at the inventory, and integration of terrestrial forest ecosystem research on the Web-Gis (DYN-CROFOR) platform incorporating automatized procedures for retrieving remote sensing data (such as MODIS and MERIS vegetation indices) and with the addition of incorporating Data mining procedures and the full power of R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Project workflow consists of four, interrelated, work packages: a) INVENTORY, b) AUTOMATIZATION, c) MINING, d) UPGRADING. AFORENSA will contribute with speeding-up of future exploratory forest ecosystem research, and with its capability of near real time data processing will present a basis for the development of “Forest watch”; an observatory for early determination of potentially harmful effects of Climate Change on forest ecosystem services such as biodiversity and water. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|Forest environmental services, Remote sensing, Ecohydrology, Biodiversity, GIS, Climate change|

A new sight proposed by this project is in the merging of so far separate research teams involved in the development of advanced textile materials, through targeted eco-driven surface modifications. Surface pre-treatments and modification will be carried out on selected sustainable textile materials, using environmentally friendly substances and processes, in order to attain antimicrobial, flame retardant, oil/hydrophobic, wellness or medical properties obtaining high added value textiles. Different environmentally friendly methods of microwave, ultrasound or plasma modification processes will be used to enhance targeted functionalities as well as to increase interfacial adhesion between fibres and polymer matrix in fibre reinforced composites. The other approach of the production of highly active surfaces which will have capability to block UV and microwave radiation, enhance oil and water repellence, antimicrobial, self-cleaning, and flame retardant properties is in the application of micro/nano-particles such as TiO2, ZnO, Cu, Ag and Au. These particles can be applied on the surface of fibers, textiles, clothing or inlayers for footwear. Detailed characterization of each treatment effectiveness, so as their effect on humans and the environment will be investigated. Laundering durability and maintenance properties are equally important as the effectiveness of developed advanced material. Introduction of novel eco-driven surface modification processes in textile production will be complemented by the risk analysis and sustainability issues, focusing onto production and product safety, usage and recyclability of newly developed product without significant environmental burden. Innovative textile products will be directed towards the needs of the textile, chemical, pharmaceutical or medical industries. 					 				|	|Textile technology|	|advanced materials, textiles, surface modification, fibre reinforced composites, nano-metal particles, LCA,|

Ivica Rubelj|	|Aging is a physiological process characterized by a gradual decline in physical fitness and other functional capabilities. The mechanisms of aging and possible actions of slowing down or ameliorating aging-related processes are poorly understood. In humans, one of the characteristics of old age is polypharmacy, which elevates risks of drug-drug interactions and drug-induced adverse reactions and organ toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These reactions may partially result from diminished drug metabolism and/or mainly from impaired activity/expression of various membrane transporters that are responsible for drug excretion in liver and kidneys. These both mechanisms have been poorly studied in senescent organs. Here we promote a hypothesis that the aging-induced oxidative stress, known to downregulate the activity/expression of the aging suppressor gene (Klotho) and to shorten the length of telomeres, also diminishes the activity/expression of various membrane transporters in liver and kidneys, and that these changes can be ameliorated by treating animals with antioxidants resveratrol and melatonin. The extent and the intensity of aging-related changes, and the beneficial effects of antioxidants may be sex-related. To test this hypothesis, we propose various biochemical and cell- and molecular-biological studies of aging parameters and aging-dependent expression of various membrane transporters in the mammalian liver and kidneys using a rat model of experimental aging. Possible aging-related decline in the expression of these transporters may explain a higher incidence (women &gt; man) of drug interactions and toxicity in old people. The studies will define the underlying cellular mechanisms that contribute to generation of the aging-related pathophysiological conditions in the liver and kidneys, and will indicate possible ways of their amelioration. Positive results may point to remedies to be used for improving the health of elderly people. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|aging, antioxidants, drug transporters, hepatotoxicity, liver, kidney, Klotho, membrane transporters, nephrotoxicity, oxidative stress, telomeres|

Such vertex algebras also appear in the logarithmic conformal field theory. By using methods developed in the papers by D. Adamović and A. Milas: Adv. Math. 217 (2008), Comm. Math.

An emphasis will be put on the tensor categories of modules of C2-cofinite vertex algebras, the determination of fusion rules, orbifold vertex subalgebras and the explicit realization of logarithmic representations. A part of the research will be devoted to some combinatorial aspects of the representation theory of affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras. We will study the application of intertwining operators on the determination of combinatorial bases of Feigin-Stoyanovsky type subspace and the associated fermionic character formulas developed by M.

Today, DNA and RNA sequencing are now key components of research carried out in many laboratories. The total amount of available genomic data is increasing approximately tenfold every year, a rate much faster than Moore’s Law for computational processing power. The exponential growth of genomic datasets leads to a situation, where computing power becomes a critical issue. The overarching goal of the project is to develop accurate, fast algorithms and tools for analyzing the whole genome-sequencing data. The emphasis of the project is on the output data from the third-generation of sequencing machines that produce longer, more error-prone sequence reads. The basis of the project are sequence alignment algorithms, graph algorithms and signal processing methods. They will be implemented for DNA sequence assembly, sequenced RNA data and sequence similarity database search. The algorithms should feasibly handle data obtained from mammalian and plant genomes (sizes greater than one billion base pairs). Special emphasis will be put on multi-core, many-core and intra-core parallelism. Additionally, the algorithms should provide good scalability over the available underlying computational architecture. All implementations of algorithms will be performed in C/C++. The research will result in the development of novel algorithms tailored to specifications of current and future long-read sequencing data. The implemented methods will further the state-of-the-art of sequence similarity database search, RNA-seq mapping and DNA assembly, ideally providing researchers with methods that return results in feasible time with limited computational resources. This, in turn could affect the current practices of genomic research; help designing new medical strategies and enable faster and more accurate analyses and diagnoses. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|genome sequence, DNA sequence alignment, RNA-seq mapping, database search, algorithms, GPU|

The main proposition is that tourism, as an enormous economic and social force, can be a significant contributor to the vision for sustainable world. The vision for personal is an urgency today and already the new group of culture creatives is identified spearheading this movement. This vision is also embedded in the overall vision of Europe 2020 for creation of more just and inclusive societies and provision of greater quality of lives for all citizens. This proposition will be analysed from three aspects: by capturing the transformative power of past and present travel experience of the culture creatives, motivations and practises of pioneering change-makers who create transformational travel products and tourism stakeholders’ receptiveness to integrate transformational view of tourism into design of their products. The research will employ mixed-method approach, involving quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (in-depth interviews, focus groups, workshops, diary) methods. The research on the theme is in infancy and the project builds the existing research in three ways. In contrast to the existing studies, the research will focus on those whose values are transformed and will seek to capture the role of travel experience in that process, on the long term behavioural change following the travel in contrast to the existing focus on immediate post-trip attitude change. The research will also overcome the existing host – industry – guest divide, as it will include entrepreneurial perspective of transformative travel providers, mainstream industry players and host communities in the process of fostering activities which can facilitate societal transformation through tourism. 					 				|	|Economy|	|culture, tourism, transformation, values, behaviour, change|

Due to the complexity of the problems regarding the object of research, and in case the newly constructed test does not show satisfactory metric characteristics, a secondary aim is set which entails revalidation and selection of one or more existing “non-specific” tests which will be proven appropriate for each sport after testing the metric characteristics. The project is designed as a research in duration of 36 months. For the purposes of realization of the aims set, the research will be conducted on a sample of 300 subjects minimum, divided into subsamples according to sport, gender and age category (cadets, juniors, seniors). The project consists of three phases. In the first phase a Web page and computer application will be created for: input, storage, reviewing and monitoring of subjects and results, and, based on a pilot study and previous findings, a certain number of the existing “non-specific” measuring instruments will be selected. In the second phase of the project data will be collected on anthropometric characteristics and the level of anaerobic capacities of the subjects will be measured by field tests with confirmed metric characteristics. At the same time, the construction of a new specific measuring instrument will begin during the second phase. The third phase of the project includes the testing of metric characteristics of the newly constructed specific field test for assessing anaerobic capacities in kicking combat sports, as well as the selection of the existing tests appropriate for practical application on a specific sample. After the project is finished, selection normative according to sport, gender and age category will be created based on the obtained results. 					 				|	|Kinesiology|	|anaerobic capacity, combat sport, test construction, taekwondo, karate, kickboxing, fitness tests,|

Thus the prevention and protection against zoonotic parasites in fishery products designated for human consumption has recently become a priority. Consequently, health authorities and fishing industry have increasingly become aware of the significance of nematode genus Anisakis, which affects human health and the commercial value of fish products. Adriatic fish, marketed fresh, frozen, salted or marinated and exported to EC, are frequently rejected on the border because of Anisakis infection. Although considered one of the most significant emerging food-borne zoonosis, anisakiasis in many Mediterranean countries is still misdiagnosed or underestimated. AnGEL will deepen the knowledge on Anisakis with a multidisciplinary approach, studying the fish as paratenic, cetaceans as the final and men as accidental host. It will start by identifying anisakids species by molecular tools in picarel and damselfish, that are particular dish in culinary tradition of SE Adriatic islands where a significant level of anti-Anisakis IgE in local population was found. It will evaluate histopathological effect of the nematode in the digestive tract of the final host in order to evaluate Anisakis carcinogenic potential, as well as its transciptomic signature during migration through hosts. It will assess larval multixenobiotic resistance mechanisms helping to design more effective therapy, and measure anti-Anisakis seroprevalence in population employed in the fish processing industry by indirect ELISA. Lastly, AnGEL will encompass resulting data in a risk analysis frame, aiming to the design of measures for the safe alimentary seafood production and strengthening of risk communication to stakeholders. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|Anisakis spp., zoonosis, seroprevalence, patohistology, transcriptomic, risk analysis|

Within the project, a progressive (model and in-situ) approach will be accomplished to reveal crucial alterations in the marine ecosystem. Initial investigations will imply model experiments on the interaction of selected OM (polysaccharides, lipids, polymeric organic matter containing N catalytic atoms) with micronutrient metals (Fe, Co, Cu, Zn and Cd). Additionally, phytoplankton monoculture incubation under various growth conditions (nutrient concentrations and temperature variations) will be included in order to comprehend multiple impacts on the phytoplankton OM production and micronutrients metals distribution. Model experiments will be followed by in-situ investigations at the selected oligotrophic and eutrophic areas of the Adriatic Sea. This will give holistic informations on the natural marine biochemical cycles and linkage between OM and micronutrient metals. In-situ investigations will be focused on the seasonal variations of the OM and micronutrient appearance and concentrations in combination with physico-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, O2), and dissolved and particulate organic carbon content, surface-active organic substances and macronutrients (PO4, NO3, NO2, NH4). These investigations will be assessed by intercomparable and multimethodological approaches using various chromatographic to electrochemical techniques. Finally, taking into account all obtained results an important part of the natural marine ecosystem processes will be characterized in the prospective of climate changes. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|organic matter, lipids, acidic polysaccharides, micronutrient metals, oligotrophy, eutrophy, monocultures, field work|

Zlatko Kregar|	|With the growing knowledge of the importance of food in maintaining the human health, the food industry is faced with increasing challenges to develop new non-thermal food treatment technologies that would prevent and mitigate food contamination while retaining nutritional and functional properties of the treated food. Electrical discharge plasma is one of these more promising techniques. Plasmas formed directly in liquid inactivate microorganisms and without significant increase in temperature during the treatment. However, knowledge gaps regarding the nature of sterilization, inactivation mechanism and the plasma reactor design have been identified as major constraints for the applicability of this technology in food industry. Thus the main goal of the proposed project is to design and develop a non-thermal plasma reactor for the treatment of fruit juices and milk and optimize it to maximize the utilization of UV light and chemical species produced by plasma. To achieve this goal, we propose to address the following research objectives (R): R1 Develop and optimize a liquid-phase plasma reactor for treatment of fruit juices and milk. R2 Characterize the chemical and electrical properties of the liquid plasmas. R3 Evaluate the ability of the liquid-phase plasma to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms in suspensions of pure culture microorganisms and suspended in fruit juices and milk respectively. R4 Determine inactivation mechanism of the plasma treatments on microorganisms R5 Determine the effect of the plasma treatments on the physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory properties of juices and milk. The significance of the proposed research lies in the development of a novel plasma reactor as well as acquires new knowledge regarding the science behind the forthcoming plasma technology which can then be applied towards introducing and potentially replacing current processing technologies with plasma. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|Electrical discharge plasma, liquid-phase plasma reactor, liquid food, physico-chemical properties, nutritional and sensory properties|

At the same time, they are not ready to change their eating habits – reduce intake of bakery products, fast food etc. and increase intake of fresh fruit and vegetable, whole grain products etc. Therefore, food industry is challenged to create products that are consumed every day (bread, snacks etc.) by large population, which are both enriched with bioactive substances and have desired sensory properties. The aim of this project is to develop new functional and enriched products based on extrusion process. Enriched grains (wheat, maize) will be used as basic material. The improvement and supplementation with biologically active (antioxidants, minerals, vitamns, fibre) will be done by addition of by-products from food industry (fruit and vegetable pomaces, oil cakes) in extrusion process. Extrusion will be used to produce final products: expanded snack products and pasta, as well as modified flours which will be used in production of bakery products and biscuits. All processes - extrusion of snack products and pasta, extrusion for flour modification, pasta drying, baking) will be optimised using response surface methodology. All products will be tested for chemical, physical, thermophysical properties, and optimal products will be sensory analysed. The results of project will be array of flours and final products with defined recipes and optimal production conditions, along with defined application of food industry by-products that significantly load environment and are not currently exploited to satisfying extent. In the project multidisciplinary approach will be applied – from agronomist, over food technologist and process engineers to sensory experts. In addition, close academia-industry links will be developed through different activities. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|Functional food, extrusion, cereals, flours, by-products, environment-friendly|

Additionally, they may provide numerous positive effects to the human health (such as risk reduction for: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension etc.). Due to large structural diversity among different groups of BACs and their physical/chemical properties it is important to identify/optimize the most effective extraction methods required to isolate and/or separate them from other plant components. Hence, various innovative extraction techniques (e.g. microwave-, ultrasound- and high-pressure- assisted extraction) will be tested for plant extracts production with high BACs content from selected MAPs grown in Croatia. Each applied extraction technique will be optimized with regards to particular MAP, increasing extraction yield, enhancing quality of extract, shortening extraction time, and decreasing solvent consumption. MAPs extracts and/or BACs will be analyzed for antioxidant properties with application of various assays (e.g. total antioxidant, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and free radical scavenging, metal chelating activities). Antiproliferative effects against tumor cells and possible protective role from lipid oxidation (including antioxidant activity) will be tested in appropriate cell line model system. The MAP extracts (dried/liquid) and BACs (extracted and/or purified separately or in mixtures) will be studied in animal models for bioavailability; absorption; antioxidant activity; as ingredient for functional food products (fortified beverages and snack bars based on Mediterranean fruits), and for possible use in diabetic/hypercholesteremic management. The obtained results may provide novel opportunities for functional product categories that are likely to have positive benefits on human health. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|medicinal and aromatic plants, innovative technologies, plant extracts, bioactive compounds, bioavailability, antioxidant properties|

In that way data of shapes and sizes that cannot be acquired with the usual methods of measurement and data processing will be obtained. Based on these data new methods of construction will be developed, for which the most applicable methods of mathematical modelling will be defined. Intelligent algorithms will be used for solving problems related to the automatic marker making, where solutions to specific problems and conditions that must be met for that purpose will be found. Using distinctive interdisciplinary approach computer programs will be developed for the purpose of construction of specific garment that is not common in our market such as overalls for professional sports, diving suits or clothes that is used for medical purposes (compression garments, etc.), and protective clothing. The development of software applications will be based on scientific knowledge, and it also can have its practical application in the manufacture of clothing.

Phraseology is primarily a linguistic and culturally multi-layered discipline. The basic unit of phraseology is a phraseme (idiom). It consists of at least two components. Its characteristic is that it is not created in the process of speaking, but is included in discourse as an already known whole. Its main features are continuity of use, integrity and a solid structure, higher or lower degree of desemanticization, a colourful nature, expressiveness and connotative meaning. The project will primarily include theoretical work on analyzing Croatian phrasemes from various aspects. Furthermore, with the application of the method of contrastive analysis, structural, semantic, etymological, motivational and cultural similarities and differences between Croatian idioms and idioms of other Slavic and non-Slavic languages will be examined. We consider the latter to be extremely important because in this way Croatian idioms would be placed in the context of European idioms. The second part of the project proposal relates to phraseographical work. Phraseography is an area that deals with the issue of compiling phraseological dictionaries. The publication of several phraseological dictionaries is planned. Particularly important will be the two phraseological dictionaries which will be completely new in a conceptual sense (a trilingual dictionary of associations and a dictionary of gender-marked phrasemes). All dictionaries will be compiled according to the latest phraseographical methodology. In addition, we should mention the work on the updated edition of the Bibliography of Croatian phraseology. We believe both of these aspects to be very important for the recognition of Croatian phraseology and phraseography within European phraseology, phraseography, Slavic studies and philology. 					 				|	|Philology|	|phraseme, phraseology, phraseography, dictionaries, contrastive linguistics, Croatian, Slavic languages, non-Slavic languages|

It is expected that this work will provide data for understanding a number of important issues regarding behavioral and possibly biological aspects of human groups during a time when Late Glacial hunter gatherers were forced to change and adapt to a changing environmental and other pressures. Presence of Mousterian artefacts at one of the sites, and Upper Paleolithic tool types at another suggests two populations (i.e. Neandertals and anatomically modern humans) were present in the region during the Late Pleistocene. Data from the proposed excavations may provide a basis to test some of the highly debated questions regarding the relation of biological population to behavioral aspects (e.g. whether Neandertals or anatomically modern humans were responsible for Early Upper Paleolithic, is there a sharp distinction in behavior and anatomy between these groups etc. Furthermore, at one site early Mesolithic is documented, while at another Late Mesolithic is present, allowing similar issues regarding behavior and other aspects to be tested, including issues related to the transition to Neolithic (agricultural) lifestyle. A comparison of data between all four sites could provide us with a basis for testing of issues related to changing life ways, land use, movement patterns, site use, biological aspects (similarities and differences), contact zones, mobility, continuity, etc. at times of changing climatic and environmental conditions and thus help us to understand this crucial time period, in particular, and how humans respond to such changes, in general. Results from the project will also provide a basis for development of archaeology–based tourism and thus directly benefit the local community and Croatian economy in the long run. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neandertals, archaeology, caves, Croatia, prehistory, Pleistocene, Holocene|

Drago Marguš|	|Natural protected areas (NPAs) are a crucial part of nature conservation; many of them are tourist hotspots. Managers of NPAs have to balance environmental protection and tourism to maximize socio-economic benefits while avoiding irreparable environmental consequences. Since 1978, carrying capacity for tourists (CCT) has been recognized and legislated as a crucial tool in finding the balance. CCT is traditionally defined as the maximum number of people concurrently visiting an area without irreversibly damaging physical, economic, and/or socio-cultural environment. In practice, managers determine acceptable level of environmental damage, and then use adaptive management to achieve and maintain that damage level. We propose a more conservation-oriented approach of estimating CCT that maximizes nature protection. Although every tourist damages the environment, he/she also contributes to protection by providing financial assets. Without revenues from tourism, protection is significantly underfunded because meeting protection and educational goals of NPAs requires costly activities such as research, oversight, mitigation, and management. We propose to estimate CCT as the maximum number of visitors for which the marginal contribution to nature protection is positive, with the requirement that visitor satisfaction not be compromised. We will first formalize the estimation procedure, then identify tourist activities with their consequences on the environment and socio-economic parameters, develop general models for common factors affecting environmental quality of the NPAs, and integrate the models into a GIS-based framework. Finally, we will demonstrate the approach by estimating CCT for two very different protected areas crucial for Croatian tourism and the local economy: NP Krka and PP Telašćica. While the new way of estimating CCT will initiate a paradigm shift in NPA management, the two applications will contribute to Croatia's nature conservation and economy. 					 				|	|Biology|	|carrying capacity, nature protected area management methods, conservation, environmental modeling, calculation, GIS, tourism, NP Krka, PP Telašćica|

The onset of the disease is mainly associated with the immune status, gut microbiota and food intake. The current scientific knowledge of specific triggers and diagnostic markers is limited; therefore, new data on gut microbiota, inflammatory, endocrine and nutritional status are required to better understand the IBD pathophysiology. It this study we will thoroughly explore host-gut microbiota interactions in order to define novel strategies for management of IBD. We will collect intestine biopsies, stool and blood samples from 40 newly diagnosed IBD patients and 20 non-IBD control individuals, as well as record their nutritional status. Since majority of the gut microorganisms are not culturable, we will use the in house available next-generation sequencing to characterize the composition of the microbiota in collected samples. Moreover, specific blood biomarkers, including cytokines, growth factors and hormones, will be determined using novel and highly sensitive proximity extension assays, recently developed in our laboratories. Collectively, these results will support better stratification of patients and initiate an appropriate therapy. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|IBD, microbiota, blood biomarker, tissue, translational research, clinical research|

Structure may be sometimes exposed to unexpected conditions, let say adverse or hazard conditions. These conditions may cause failures making structure incapable to perform the function for which it has been designed. The task is to make an assessment of the structure behaviour at mentioned conditions and decide if the structure is capable for further operation. This means the assessment should provide an answer if the structure has sustained irreparable damage. Therefore, the main objective is to provide an assessment of structure behaviour, by comparing of the parameters like stress, strain, crack occurring, etc., caused by certain load level and temperature at this unexpected limit state with those allowed by material properties. To assess structural behaviour in operation at limit state, the following research sub-objectives should be accomplished: testing of material properties for the different environmental conditions; definition of impact energy as well as the determination of the crack driving force and life assessment of structural elements; evaluation of the semi-rigid structural joints/connections behaviour; development of a numerical algorithm for optimization of semi-rigid framed structures; creep buckling simulations of composite beam-type structures; proper constitutive modelling at limit operating conditions (i.e. plasticity, damage, thermomechanical coupling); application of new materials to be used at limit state – nanocomposites.

The diagnosis, which is usually given during the preschool period, depends on the education and experience of human evaluators, which can be susceptible to personal bias. The ongoing collaboration between the researchers from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER) and Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences (ERF) initiated the use of humanoid robots in the process of ASD diagnostic procedures in preschool children. The goal of the project is the development of a robot-based diagnostic protocol and testing of its verification in clinical settings. The robots will be used as ASD co-evaluators to help a human evaluator to assess the child behavior objectively. To the best of our knowledge, such a robot-based ASD diagnostics system will be the first of its kind. Technically, this means developing specific robot skills and behaviors to be deployed within the standard clinical diagnostic procedure of ASD. The robots will have two functions: observation and quantitative measurement of child’s social responses; and performance of standardized social presses designed to provoke child response. This involves actions such as analyses of the audio signal and differentiation of vocalizations and speech, detection of eye-gaze direction, performance of different actions and gestures and utilization of human-robot and robot-robot interaction to attract child attention. Our interdisciplinary approach includes ERF's development of diagnostic protocol and its testing on children with and without ASD and FER's realization of needed robot behaviors using methods and algorithms from social signal processing, computer vision, machine learning and cognitive reasoning. This involves work on cooperation, cognition and human-robot interaction, focusing on multimodal communication. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|social robotics, humanoid robots, autism, small children, diagnostics, rehabilitation|

Our research proposal fits very well with this recent development. First of all, the work of Arthur has its local application in the classification of representations of discrete series that was done by Moeglin and Tadić. Based on those results we plan to pursue the following investigations in the representation theory of p-adic groups. We would like to compute the Jacquet modules of discrete series representations completely.This will help us understand representations parabolically induced from those discrete series (generalized principal series) completely. This will have consequence on the problems of determination of complementary series for classical groups a problem related to the classification of unitary representations. Results of Gan, Savin and Ichino will help us extend some of those results to metaplectic groups. This will have important consequence on the determination of theta correspondence for dual pairs consisting of odd orthogonal and metaplectic groups such as explicit determination of all theta lifts. In the theory of automorphic forms, we would like to understand the construction of Arthur and Moeglin more explicitly. This will construct new series of square integrable representations; some special cases were obtained earlier by Muić, and Muić and Hanzer.This will give locally many interesting unitary representations which are more complicated than that has appeared in earlier works of Speh, Rogawski, Tadić, Muić, Savin, and Hanzer. We will apply those methods to study cohomology and poles of automorphic L-functions. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|automorphic forms, representations, Eisenstein series, cuspidal forms, theta correspondence|

The geopolitical strategy of Rome in conquered regions was to encourage the integration process, where the Roman army gave its contribution. Archaeological data testify that the indigenous communities of Illyricum reacted differently to this process. Some were willing to accept the Roman heritage (e.g. Liburnians), while the others (e.g. Delmatae) were providing resistance. Given previous research today we have a number of valuable studies about certain aspects of Roman domination. However, they are primarily focused either on the ancient written sources or the archaeological material from Dalmatia and Pannonia. This research of the integration would cover for the first time the Roman military presence on the area of Croatia. The main focus is on the Roman military sites along the Dalmataean and the the Danube limes. New data will be derived using the methodology purposely created for this project and includes archaeological survey, classification, comparison and evaluation of all available data both archaeological and ancient sources with the application of the variable of geographic origin. Such research has never been undertaken in Croatia. The results would fill the informational gaps that exist for this part of the Empire through the analysis of the largest possible amount of information about the Roman army activities and the integration of indigenous people. The project leader’s research has focused so far on the problems of Roman provincial archaeology. Many years of her successful research of and of all the collaborators guarantee the sustainability of the approach and the successful implementation of the project objectives. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Roman Empire, Danube, Mediterranean, mobility, economy, Roman military, local elite.|

Many classes of organic, inorganic or hybrid materials are produced by process of precipitation (crystallization) in which the size, morphology, chemical and structural composition could be tuned by the strict control of formation conditions. Process by which living organisms produce hard tissues is known as biomineralization and such tissues are, actually, the organic-inorganic composites. In comparison to their geological analogues, biominerals have the superior mechanical and chemical properties that are a consequence of just a minor presence of extracellular matrix proteins or polysaccharides, as well as of the specific confined environment in which the process occur. In addition, such materials are produced from aqueous systems, chemically neutral precursors, at low temperature and pressure, thus inspiring the scientists investigating the biomimetic syntheses routes for design of functional materials for advanced application. In order to contribute to the understanding of basic interactions between the mineral phases and complex macromolecules, underlying biomineralization, we propose the investigations in which the representative inorganic salts (calcium carbonates &amp; phosphates) will be precipitated in a presence of simple and representative organic molecules (acidic and hydrogen bonding amino acids and custom-designed small peptides) while the complexity of systems will be systematic increased by confining the precipitation in polysaccharide hydrogel or synthetic vesicular microenvironment. Particular attention will be paid on a role of the amorphous and other precursor phases on formation of stable modifications relevant for biomineralization. Besides the precipitation kinetic analyses, the advanced characterization techniques (HR-TEM, EPR, confocal microscopy) will be applied in order to reveal the mechanisms of organic molecules – mineral surface interactions. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Biomineralization, Calcium Phosphates, Calcium Carbonates, Precipitation, Model organic molecules|

However, the effects of different enological procedures on biological activity of wine are poorly investigated. The overall aim of this project, which represents an interdisciplinary research effort of experts from fields of biotechnology and biomedicine, is to investigate how different enological procedures in wine making (changes of maceration time, partial/complete dealcoholization, aging of wine) may affect its biological activity. This also includes investigation of potential differences in distinctive biological effects between wines obtained by the technology of white and red wine production. In contrast to the process of red wine production, in the white wine production there is no maceration in contact with grape seeds and skins, and only fermentation of immediately separated grape juice occurs. So, biological potentials of white wines may considerably differ from that of red wines. Conversely, if even short maceration is allowed in the process of white wine making, polyphenolic content and antioxidant potential of such wines is significantly enhanced. There are several studies demonstrating superior effects of red versus white wine on certain cardiovascular parameters. However, epidemiological evidence demonstrating specific benefits of red over white wine is poor and conclusive studies comparing the two are missing. Detailed biochemical analyses of all test wines will be performed and their biochemical properties will be correlated with their biological activity. Among numerous biological effects of wine and its constituents, this project focuses on cardiovascular, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of wine that will be examined on a spectrum of in vitro and in vivo biological systems including small laboratory animals and human volunteers. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|wine, wine technology, cardiovascular, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant|

In the case of antimicrobial peptides, measured biological activity and therapeutic index data will be collected from published papers with the goal of constructing robust and accurate predictive models. A large amount of data regarding the 20 natural amino acids attributes will also be collected and analysed. We plan to propose new scales of amino-acid attributes that may be a basis for a multitude of future studies. In our experience, construction of good predictive models is not possible without using biophysical insights to propose appropriate molecular descriptors crucial for data-mining procedure and model building. These models should be based on newly developed molecular descriptors. Study of molecular descriptors will be important part of this project, their extremal properties (as indicators of the most active compounds), their complexity of calculation (since exhaustive search for optimal compounds can be computationally demanding) and their interrelationships. Dedicated algorithms for in-silico identification or proposal of structures with the desired properties will be built and verified through synthesis, characterization and testing of predicted antimicrobials. The activity, selectivity, conformation and mechanism of action of lead compounds will be explored using biophysical, biochemical and microbiological techniques. Preliminary investigations by our group of graduate, doctoral and postdoctoral biophysics students has already led to the identification of two designed peptides as being very active against pan-resistant Acetinobacter baumanni, so that initial drug development is within the scope of this project with the aim of finding new classes of non-toxic peptide antibiotics active against multidrug resistant bacteria. 					 				|	|Biology|	|Antimicrobial peptides, Molecular descriptors, Therapeutic index, Drug development, Design, Data-mining, Antibiotics, Multidrug resistance|

Specific phytoplankton ecological preferences drive their temporal and spatial distribution, reflecting their dependence on specific temperature ranges, light levels, nutrient availability and other environmental gradients. Hence, some phytoplankton taxa can be used as water mass tracers (biotracers). We hypothesize that picophytoplanktonic prokaryote Prochlorococcus and nanophytoplanktonic eukaryotes coccolithophores: Emiliania huxleyi and/or Gephyrocapsa oceanic are such organisms, and can be used for tracing water masses in the Adriatic. Here, we propose interdisciplinary study where oceanography, taxonomy of phytoplankton and molecular recognition are combined to detect and follow water masses. Two winter cruises in the southern Adriatic will be conducted with station positions and sampling depths defined in situ. Water mass detection will be based on pre-defined physical characteristics; however, we also plan to use optical measurements in conjunction with the proposed sampling to develop an optical based criterion for definition of the targeted water masses. Phytoplankton community will be assessed using multiple tools to confirm the presence and to determine distribution, abundance and diversity of the proposed biotracers in sampled water masses. With the variability and trends of the Adriatic circulation as well as the water mass characteristics brought on by changing climate, we believe that proposed study is timely and needed as it is offering a holistic and integrated approach to oceanography of the Adriatic. Most importantly, this study is proposing to develop a new set of interdisciplinary tools that will be essential for future research activities. 					 				|	|Biology|	|Adriatic Sea, climate changes, water mass tracers, cyanobacteria, coccolithophorids|

Several studies have shown that infratentorial lesions are related to conversion rate and long-term prognosis for patients with CIS and thus may help to identify patients at high risk for earlier occurrence of clinically relevant disability. Bearing in mind the poor correlation between clinical symptoms and MRI findings there is a need for ancillary tools in the evaluation of brainstem pathology in MS. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of the brainstem evoked potentials score (bilateral AEP, bilateral ocular and cervical VEMP and bilateral tongue SSEP), the modified evoked potentials score (combination of brainstem evoked potentials score and VEP and SSEP of the median and tibial nerve) and standardized autonomic nervous system testing (Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS)) in the prediction of conversion from CIS to MS and accumulation of future disability. After 24 months of follow-up, this study could reveal the prognostic value of the brainstem EP score, modified EP score and CASS in patients with CIS on a number of parameters including: time until second relapse, accumulation of disability, accumulation of MRI lesions in the first 6 months, time to conversion from CIS to MS according to the 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria, number of relapses in the first 2 years of follow up. It can be presumed that the brainstem EP score and CASS score as direct and indirect measures of brainstem dysfunction, respectively will prove as reliable markers of future disability of CIS and MS patients. As a consequence, this would allow us to start more appropriate treatment in a subset of patients with higher probability of worse outcome. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|clinically isolated syndrome, multiple sclerosis, evoked potentials, autonomic nervous system testing, brainstem|

Higher automatization reduces the need for human labour and China manufacturing is posing a considerable threat. Manufacturing companies in developed countries are seeking ways to stay competitive on the global market since a considerable part of their GDP is acquired by manufacturing, but unfortunately, shrinking. At the moment there are two large scale projects exploring manufacturing sector: EMS and GMRG Survey. Both surveys look at different aspects of manufacturing and engage different countries. EMS covers 18, while GMRG survey includes 24 countries including China, Taiwan and others. The main objective for application is to enable Croatian scientist to be equal partners in such large scale projects and access data from other countries and carry out comparative analyses that will benefit the researchers and manufacturing industry in Croatia. It must be emphasized that Faculty of Business and Economics is the partner for both EMS and GMRG project for number of years but never had the chance to exploit the privileges. Both surveys explore in detail manufacturing so willingness of the industry to participate is essential. In order to do that, Faculty of Business and Economics will have to provide several workshops on which participants will see the comparative results between countries and be motivated to participate in the next round. All the acquired knowledge will be shared with industry experts and all the results will be available on the internet page of the host Institution. The project is interdisciplinary because it investigates the manufacturing technology and processes, as well as the usage of novel materials. Therefore colleagues from Engineering Sciences are participating in the project since the latest results in manufacturing research shows that advanced technology and advanced materials are the only source left for sustaining the competitive advantage in comparison to China. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Manufacturing, manufacturing practices, technology, organizational innovations, EMS, GMRG, Croatia|

The goal is to shed light and to interconnect different views of the problem, therefore deepening the understanding of the subject area, and offer preventive and curative solutions. This is necessary because insolvency, on business level, disables development and adequate business and financial restructuring, on personal level it destroys an individual and a family, whereas at social level it creates poverty and enhances negative economic trends. Goals are aimed at: different levels of the principal groups of insolvency and over-indebtedness actors, which are: business, personal and public level, and at business environment as a platform for finding better indebtedness management possibilities. The results of the business level research should significantly improve the prediction possibilities of financial distress and enable larger time-opportunity-window to exploit different restructuring options. Also, the results should provide the scientific knowledge of such financial management that would encourage business development by financial leverage and not threaten the survival of business entities because of the inadequate capital structure. The results of the personal level research should make way to the widespread alteration of approach to new debt. New personal finance culture pattern is expected to be backed by these results and should emerge both among individuals (as demand force of debt), and financial institutions (as supply force of debt). Project proposal is directed toward the research of four distinctive segments of business environment, predominantly of political – legal or economic origin: personal insolvency regulation, business insolvency regulation, monetary and fiscal possibilities in overcoming excessive indebtedness, and banks and financial industry in generating anticipative consumption causing excessive indebtedness. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Business Insolvency, Personal Insolvency, Indebtedness, Bankruptcy Law, Restructuring|

The existence of a pulmopulmonary baroreceptor reflex that originates in the large pulmonary branches, unrelated to the vagus nerve has been reported (1,2,3). Very recently, experimentally induced acute pulmonary hypertension in 10 Mongolian dogs was completely abolished by radiofrequency pulmonary artery denervation at the main bifurcation area of the left pulmonary artery (4). Also,the effect of radiofrequency pulmonary artery denervation on functional capacity and hemodynamics showed significant reduction of mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in 13 patients with IPAH not responding optimally to medical therapy(5). The aim of research proposal is to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency and cryodenervation of pulmonary arteries on decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in 20 patients with IPAH (mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25 mmHg) and in 20 patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary disease or due to left heart disease not responding optimally to medical therapy. Already well established and aproved radifrequency and cryo ablation technology modified for pulmonary artery denervation will be utilized in proposed clinical trial of new indication. All procedures will be performed in the Clinical Hospital Center Catheterization laboratory. Proposed duration of the trial is 4 years. Expected scientific contribution of this clinical trial might provide invaluable impact on improvement of quality of life and possibly on a deacrease in mortality of patients with pulmonary hypertension. Positive results of proposed study might generate several scientific publications, doctoral theses and above all would strengthen the international scientist collaboration and reputation of Medical Faculty of University of Zagreb. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, secondary pulmonary hypertension, radiofrequency denervation, cryodenervation, pulmonary arteries|

Several forms are classified in clinical practice, depending on the main pathogenic mechanism: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used mouse model of RA and is still an indispensible tool to study the disease pathogenesis. Through the production of osteoresorptive mediators by immune cells, chronic inflammation in arthritis creates a microenvironment that promotes osteoresorption by osteoclasts (OC). OCs are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells arising from myeloid hematopoietic lineage. A number of systemic and local stimuli, such as hormones and cytokines/chemokines, promote osteoclastogenesis by enhancing OC differentiation, migration, activation, lifespan and function, but the exact mechanisms of how the inflammatory network works in vivo in the context of arthritis are largely unclear. Particularly, the human osteoclast progenitor (OCP) populations are not precisely defined and it is, as yet, unknown which critical mediators have the potential to activate OCPs and attract them to produce joint lesions. Using the mouse model of CIA and samples from arthritic patients we propose to elucidate differentiation sequence of early progenitors into mature OCs, shifts in the frequency of discrete OCP subpopulations and their migration patterns during arthritis. We plan to identify distinct OCP subpopulations in the bone marrow, periphery and joint lesions, their migratory and homing patterns, and their functional links to bone loss in arthritis. We expect to define the properties of inflammatory microenvironment in the regulation of OC trafficking, differentiation and activity in arthritis. A better characterization of arthritis-induced OCP subpopulations could offer the potential to design therapeutic approaches to control their migration and curtail their osteoresorptive potential. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|osteoclasts, arthritis, inflammation, progenitors, differentiation, cytokines, chemokines|

Purification and analysis methods will be focused on measles virus, snake venom and antivenom proteins, and human plasma proteins. Measles virus is used as a vaccine and is found very suitable as a gene vector and as an oncolytic virotherapeutic, with the last two applications requiring large amounts of the virus. Venom is an antigen for antivenom production and both require careful analysis in order to obtain the final product of high quality. Proteins from plasma, namely albumin and immunoglobulin, are of great medical importance and their purification and stability are of utmost significance. All these biomolecules are important as biotechnological products and are subjected to rigorous quality requirements to ensure their safe usage. Therefore, non-invasive purification methods upgrading their quality and sustainable production and ensuring stability of these fragile biomolecules are essential. This project will base purification on chromatography using monolith stationary phases which are featured by their suitability for biomolecules due to high porosity, high binding capacity and convective based transport. Ion-exchange and affinity chromatography will be employed and various conditions tested for obtaining target material with high purity and yield. Also, various formulation conditions enabling preservation of virus viability and protein functionality and stability throughout the process will be tested. The analysis of the virus infectivity and protein functionality, removal of contaminants and the overall procedure effectiveness will be done by classical biochemical and virological methods as well as by some novel methods such as nanoparticle analysis that enables detection of virus and protein aggregates (NanoSight). 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|chromatography, viruses, plasma proteins, snake venom, monoliths, bioanalytics, aggregation|

It proposes a complex research outline based dominantly on qualitative methodology, aiming at untangling and comprehending multiple, multilayered and interdependent (f)actors and processes that influence contemporary transformations in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. The concept of city-making in this research refers to a comprehensive construction and articulation of urban life along two axes—space and diversity. Both constitute nodes at which global political, economic and cultural flows meet and collide with local histories, way of life, imaginaries, interests and developments, bringing about the restructuring of the city and its identity as well as identities of city inhabitants. This ethnological and cultural anthropological project emphasises agency of city dwellers in these transformations and investigates how they negotiate and re-create the given social, cultural, and spatial landscape (cityscape) investing it with meaning and humanising it. The project will have an important bearing on the city's politics and policies, with the goal of achieving more sustainable and inclusive functioning of the city while, at the same time, it will advance the state of the art of urban studies. In addition, it will ensure the transfer of knowledge via university courses and public presentations aimed at raising the awareness about various urban issues (planning, environment, representation, cultural production, diversity, marginality etc.). 					 				|	|Ethnology and anthropology|	|urban anthropology, city, everyday life and culture, politics of space, politics of difference, urban identities, anthropology of migration|

The core methodology consists in conducting philosophical investigations that are aimed at offering practical recommendations and that are constrained by knowledge of the practical setting of Croatian mental health law and care. Two central philosophical issues appear to be relevant to the philosophical investigation and, thus, addressing them is the aim of the project. First, a significant part of the contemporary debate on the social response to antisocial personality disorder centers on this notion. Some have argued that this notion involves normative preconceptions against the liberties of certain individuals. Others have questioned the accuracy and scientific robustness of the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorders and its precision of related risk predictions. Second, the justification for choosing the appropriate treatment for people with antisocial personality disorder must also be a moral one. In particular, a relevant type of moral justification has to be grounded in principles that correlate psychological descriptions and explanations of a person’s behavior with his or her degree of responsibility. Similarly, compulsory treatment appears to be conditional upon a person’s diminished responsibility or capacity to act accordingly to a treatment decision, together with the existence of a risk to themselves or to others. The philosophical investigation of the project will be integrated with the contributions of a leading forensic psychiatrist in Croatia, a sociological qualitative analysis of the practices and challenges that are encountered by institutional representatives in the forensic department of the Rab psychiatric hospital and an historical investigation of the institutional response to antisocial personality disorder in the region in the period 1918-1980. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|antisocial personality disorders, psychiatric classification, psychiatric explanation, moral responsibility, Croatian mental health law and care|

Particular attention will be paid to the analysis of drought, floods and heat waves. Possible change in climate suitability for tourism will be investigated. The obtained gridded fields will become a reference data for the validation of climate models and an input into the flash-flood warning systems. Current and future climate of the Mediterranean area will be examined by analyzing the results of global-model simulations and by using the statistical and dynamical downscaling approach. Simulations by RegCM4.2 regional climate model will be performed at the horizontal resolution of 12.5 km. Also planned is to utilize results from experiments based on coupled atmosphere-ocean models from the currently running Med-CORDEX project with a purpose of analyzing the contribution of oceanic component in the simulations over the Adriatic Sea and the surrounding land area. Trends and interdecadal variability of sea level in the Mediterranean sub-basins will be identified and contributions of the governing processes will be assessed. Coastal flooding in the Northern Adriatic and time evolution in occurrence of extreme sea levels in the context of mean-sea-level rise will be considered. Finally, older variants of semi-empirical method of projecting global sea level will be compared with the more general method recently developed. It is expected that the project thus considered will meet the three important criteria (relevance, reliability, feasibility), by addressing one of the few priorities put forward by the European Union in its growth strategy Europe 2020, by relying on the state-of-the-art methods of data analysis and modeling, and by involving a majority of researchers engaged in the study of climate-related physical processes in Croatia. 					 				|	|Geophysics|	|Adriatic, climate change, extremes, climate models, downscaling, spatial interpolation, sea-level trend, coastal flooding, sea-level projections|

Beside linear codes over finite fields and finite rings, we will also investigate quantum codes and network codes. In fact, the links and connections between codes and combinatorial structures are the main focus and emphasis of the proposed project. For constructions of the combinatorial structures and codes we will mainly use algebraic, geometric and enumerative techniques, as well as computational methods. When dealing with combinatorial structures, these include in particular constructions from finite groups and constructions using orbit matrices. The very general Kramer-Mesner method will be implemented and combined with other methods like that of tactical decompositions. Codes will be constructed directly from the obtained combinatorial structures, and vice versa. Our research in scope of this project will also include constructions of Hadamard matrices and related designs and codes. All gotten structures will be analyzed in terms of their automorphism groups and other structural (geometric, algebraic) properties. Obtained codes, designs and graphs will be compared with the previously known structures. As a result of the proposed research, we expect constructions of codes with good properties, possibly better than the presently known codes, and constructions and classifications of various combinatorial structures. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|code, network coding, t-design, q-ary design, graph, strongly regular graph, finite group|

However, the detailed understanding of its impact on a given process is poorly understood. Direct investigation of this phenomenon by experimental means, is a challenging endeavour, as the microscopic details are frequently hidden from macroscopic observations. Computational simulations, on the other hand, provide detailed information regarding molecular dynamics and flexibility. The theoretical approach is thus crucial in both understanding the experimental results and in expanding the underlying conceptual framework. The present project proposes to utilize state-of-the-art computational techniques to address the importance of molecular flexibility across a range of carefully selected examples from the life sciences. The examples, which can be classified under the headings: (i) peptides and spectroscopy, (ii) protein flexibility, and (iii) enzyme related transformations, have been chosen to span multiple time and length scales and thus to highlight the diverse and wide-reaching nature of molecular flexibility. The selected examples exhibit a significant degree complementarity and synergy with one another and are all associated with their own applicative importance in different areas of (bio)chemistry. In addition to the scientific research proposed, the project aims to consolidate a highly successful and competitive platform in computational life sciences that has been established at the RBI. This platform was already recognized through the granting of an EU-FP6 project (2007-2010). The current project team is thus well equipped for the proposed work and exhibits a good balance between senior researchers, with excellent track records, and junior scientists with outstanding potential. The support of the project team by HrZZ is crucial for maintaining their competitiveness in the international scientific environment of computational life sciences. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Molecular Flexibility, Computational Chemistry, Peptides, Proteins, Enzyme Catalysis|

This information is crucial for the sustainable, scientific management of coastal ecosystems, as required by EU instruments such as the Habitats Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Water Framework Directive, and the Common Fisheries Policy. The major questions asked are 1) What are the ecological baselines in Croatia in community structure? 2) How does anthropogenic activity (harvesting, coastal development) shift community structure from baseline? 3) How do marine protected areas maintain functional communities? 4) How is community structure changing over time? We will investigate these questions using innovative, non-destructive techniques for quantifying fish abundance and size distribution, and benthic habitat quality. These techniques include lure-assisted, underwater visual census which was originally developed in the Schultz laboratory; baited, underwater video; and DGPS-assisted, towed underwater video. EU policies require that non-destructive methods for assessment and monitoring replace destructive harvest-based methods currently in widespread use, and these methods are among the most scientifically supported non-destructive methods currently available. These methods will be used to quantify fish community structure and benthic habitat at all major MPAs and former MPAs in Croatia, to compare communities within MPAs to matched locations outside MPAs. Matched locations will be chosen to test for specific anthropogenic drivers of community structure, such as high fishing pressure, coastal development, marine tourism, aquaculture, and terrestrial runoff. These results will advance our basic understanding of coastal ecosystems, and will be crucial for satisfying Croatia's responsibilities as an EU citizen in MPA construction, management, and monitoring of marine resources. 					 				|	|Biology|	|community ecology, fish, Posidonia, habitat, monitoring|

The basic idea underlying the project stems from an apparent disparity between the rather advanced extensions of the traditional linear finite-element principles to non-linear problems and the fact that the key finite-element concept – that of interpolation of the unknown functions – is surprisingly kept mostly constant, i.e. configuration-independent. Enabling the finite-element approximation to become configuration-dependent is motivated by the existing need to improve the current non-linear finite-element procedures, in particular for mechanical problems defined on non-linear manifolds. This principle is presented as the general concept providing viable novel development paradigm with obvious benefits for a wider class of mechanical problems. The configuration-dependent approximation to be designed shall obey the essential convergence requirements, with its extra flexibility (arising from the potential of the new approximation to vary with the configuration) employed to improve the solution in some clearly defined manner. In particular, during the design process, the following two basic principles will be consistently adhered to: (i) In the limiting case where the non-linear mechanical problem becomes linear, the configuration-dependent approximation sought must coincide with a known reference interpolation for linear analysis. (ii) In a general non-linear situation, the configuration-dependent approximation should preserve a set of selected mechanical or mathematical properties of equilibrium or motion defined beforehand. In this way, a variety of finite-elements for static and dynamic analysis will be derived. 					 				|	|Basic engineering sciences|	|non-linear structural analysis, finite-element method, configuration-dependent approximation, beams, shells, dynamics|

Natural forests make up 95% of the total forests in Croatia and in its wealth geographic region contains different ecological types and a large number of the forest tree species. Global climate changes, rising temperatures, falling rainfall, occurrence of the extreme weather events directly affect on genetic diversity. The main objective of the proposed project is to make recommendations for the conservation of the genetic diversity of the forest trees. Precondition for achieving the goal is the identification and understanding of the genetic variability of the individual tree species. The research to be carried out by the project would be based on the common oak and beech. On existing genetic tests that were established at different sites, data on the survival and growth of plants, phenology, silvicultural properties, plant resistance to pests, etc should be collect. The stem forest stands from which the seed was taken will be used for collecting the data of health condition, fruiting and climatic parameters. The genetic diversity of the provenance will be analyzed by DNA markers. This project should be continued and expanded research on the identification of proven European beech resistant to drought, which are conducted in the framework of a bilateral cooperation with Germany (MSES-DAAD 2013/14) and the preservation of the gene pool and study of the variability of our most important tree species which are conducted as part of the project “Breeding and forest seed” supported by MSES of Croatia. From the economic point of view, the project aims is to raise the category of the forest reproductive material (FRM) in a higher category according to the Law of FRM (Official Gazette 75/2009, 61 /2011 - EU directive EC/105/99). Higher category guarantees a higher quality, and thus a higher price in the market. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|Genetic conservation, Climate changes, Forest , provenance trials, variability, Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica|

Such artisan products are increasingly appreciated because of their authenticity although of great consideration due to their variable microbiological and organoleptic quality. Overall monitoring of wildlife reservoir is needed in assessment its potential as sources for zoonosis agents exposures of humans as well as sources of bacterial strains relevant for enhancement and standardization of game meat sausages production. There are large variations in prevalence of microbial populations of game meat even within a single country and the published data for Croatia is limited and poorly documented which does not allow any related analysis. Especially the data on risk -based monitoring of zoonosis and antibiotic resistance genes transmission via game meat food chain in Croatia is missing and there is not authentic collection of indigenous bacterial strains that could act as a pool of novel genes and metabolic pathways relevant for high quality food production. MiCROgame focuses on the in situ diversity analysis as well as detailed characterization of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Croatian game meat sausages. Application of this autochthonous microbiota into the sausages production can influence the end-product quality and can accelerate maturation such helping producers to be more competitive on national or EU market. Special focus will be set towards identification and characterization of potential spoilage and pathogenic microflora and antibiotic resistance traits in order to estimate safety of locally produced game meat food and to identify sources of contamination. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|traditional game meat sausages, lactic acid bacteria, foodborn pathogens, antibiotic resistance, starter cultures|

Examples of such systems include the so-called smart structures composed of a large number of sensors and actuators mounted on constructive elements (beams/plates) with the goal to damp undesired vibrations or to control flow of fluids; adaptive optics with large amount of optical elements; smart electrical power systems; highways with automated cars driving in platoons. Common characteristic of all of the above mentioned systems is that they are composed of a large number of spatially distributed dynamical subsystems which operate under constant mutual interactions through some physical interconnections (network) and/or communication links (network). Today, it is widely acknowledged that the key challenge in development of such dynamical networks is synthesis of algorithms for their control. The main goal of this project is development of some of the key elements in fundamental theory of control for spatially distributed systems, together with constructive controller synthesis algorithms suitable for application in real-life problems. The research focus will be on distributed control solutions in which each dynamical system in the network is controlled by its local controller and each local controller communicates and coordinates its actions with a (usually small) set of directly neighboring controllers. Our approach will be based on innovative elements from the theory of dissipative systems, while both spatially invariant networks and generic dynamical networks with arbitrary interconnection graph will be considered. The developed control algorithms will be verified in laboratory experiments on groups of mobile robots and on a distributed vibration control platform. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|control systems, distributed control, optimization, large-scale systems, vibrations|

Thereby the requirements on dynamic functioning of these systems can be achieved by different system interactions, whereas some of them are more preferable than the others from the standpoints of energy consumption or other criteria like price of operation or equivalent pollution. The global objective of the project 3CON is to research and develop optimal control techniques on significantly different large consumers – building systems and railway traffic systems – in conceptually identical way: by applying the principle of hierarchical decomposition of systems and cooperative optimal controls between the hierarchy levels. In that way the computed energy consumption profile on the lower level directly maximizes the global economic gain of the system operation in the presence of system constraints (e.g. allowed temperatures or fixed train travelling time). This will enable the proactive role of these largest consumers in energy grids of the future (smart grids). It will make them responsive and in position to best exploit the imposed varying energy exchange terms. Thereby vast possibilities in energy grid management through dynamic pricing will be opened – foremost for reducing losses between generation and consumption points in the grid and increasing grid reliability. The secondary global objective of this installation grant is to build an internationally competent research group in control of energy-intensive systems on the Faculty which is also recognized and accepted by relevant domestic companies. The project developments will be verified through building and railway traffic case studies that will be supervised by relevant Croatian companies. This will ensure that all relevant system issues are taken care of in the design and that the design itself is close to exploitation. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|optimal control, hierarchical control, building, railway traffic system, energy consumption, power flow optimisation, prosumer, smart grid|

Common methods applied to make use of biomass energy potential are biochemical and thermochemical conversion methods. Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical process carried out in the absence of oxygen that yields with three different end-products – bio-oil, biochar and syngas. Pyrolysis of agricultural residues can help meet renewable energy targets by displacing fossil fuels and, thereby, deal with concerns regarding the global warming. Unlike direct combustion, pyrolysis yields with more end-products. Bio-oil has environmental benefits as a clean fuel and causes less pollution as compared to fossil fuels, whereas biochar can be put on soil and act as a carbon-sequestering and climate-mitigating agent. Based on the above-mentioned, the overall objective of this project is to determine the potential of different types of biomass residues and waste, and dedicated crops, for bio-oil and biochar production via pyrolysis. Since the type of feedstock significantly influences the pyrolysis process and the yield of end-products, the specific objective of the proposed project will be to determine the potential of pyrolysis from different biomass feedstock collected in two climatically different regions, Mediterranean and Continental Croatia. Project will be split into three main phases, including feedstock collection and characterization, biomass pyrolysis, and end-products' (bio-oil and biochar) characterization. This will provide the most detailed database so far, speaking worldwide, and should result with the information on the optimum feedstock, concerning the available biomass in relation to the region. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|waste agricultural biomass, dedicated crops, conversion, pyrolysis, energy, added value products, bio-oil, biochar|

Climate change evokes new demands for successful wheat breeding such as adaptability to various abiotic stress factors. The most important traits that are affected with climate changes such as drought are yield and quality. Drought tolerance in wheat is quantitative trait with very complex phenotype and genetic control. Significant number of wheat traits has different influence level on drought tolerance. Current global research trend is directed toward development of functional markers linked with wheat adaptability traits. Functional markers are derived from polymorphic sites within the gene that are directly associated with phenotypic variation. Proposed project includes total of 364 wheat accessions originated from five continents. Aims of the project are: assessment of phenotypic and molecular genetic diversity of wheat breeding germplasm; identification of existing functional markers for agronomical important traits in tested germplasm; identification of marker-trait associations; outlining the most suitable parents for future crossing and breeding programs. Project will include phenotyping of traits that are linked with wheat adaptability to drought. This project will contribute to improvement of knowledge of wheat genome research and detection of candidate genes for major marker-traits associations. Knowledge gained through this project will be helpful to better understand genetic control of wheat traits important for adaptation to climate change and drought tolerance.

The project spans the period from the 1780s, which was marked by great changes in the Hapsburg Monarchy during the reign of Joseph II, to the end of the Second World War when political circumstances brought an end to the integrity of Central Europe. The project has been conceived as a broad-based research of fine and applied arts (painting, sculpture, architecture, graphic arts, photography, comics, cartoons, etc.) through multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches using methods pertaining to humanities and social sciences. Research will comprise topics relating to (mis)use of art for or against political regimes, artistic heritage of marginalized groups, the concept of unwanted heritage and institutional construction of art discourses and their reception. Understanding sociopolitical background can contribute to greater understanding of heritage-based conflicts, while indications of the transnational nature of Central European art can encourage its protection and ensure its sustainability. The research team, headed by an assistant professor from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, consists of academic researchers, doctoral candidates, and professionals from museums and monument protection institutes. Expected results and outcomes of the project include publications on the given topics, a more profound scientific knowledge about art developments within sociopolitical contexts and future collaboration with foreign researchers. 					 				|	|Art history|	|Croatia, Central Europe, 19th Century Art, 20th Century Art, Modernism, Sociopolitical Context, Art Discourses, Visual Communication, Popular Culture|

Thus the project covers the period of about 70 years, from 1914/1918 to 1991. The project will cover complete present day Croatian territory as well as neighbouring areas where necessary. The project will include various topic – ideologies and politics, national and religious questions, as well as culture, especially the role of media and sport in the social life. Research will cover a wide range of events and historical processes: formation and spreading of national and political ideas and their realization through the activities of political parties and movements; organization of state security and police; reconstruction of everyday life; the question of identity of various groups of Croatian society. The project will also cover the biographies of certain persons and how certain regimes treated them. More specifically the project will research the consequences of World War I on the population; the activities of state authorities of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes/Yugoslavia, Independent State of Croatia, Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia/Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia and to the present day Republic of Croatia. The research will concentrate on the question of freedom of nations and individuals and the influence of external political forces. 					 				|	|History|	|Croatia, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Independent State of Croatia, Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, democracy, dictatorship, totalitarianism|

The international team will implement already elaborated methodologies combined with new technologies (geo-radar, remote sensing) on the medieval artistic heritage of Croatia as to track and map the changes that occurred in monumental landscape in the time span from late antiquity to the late middle ages. Croatia was a border zone between super-powers: eastern and western Roman Empire; Byzantium and respectively Lombard, Carolingian, Ottonian rule; from the 11th c. on, the powers of the West change: the Papacy and Venice, then Hungary. The ecclesiastical and social elites as protagonists of political and diplomatic activities have always strengthened their power by investing and sponsoring architecture and works of art. Those investors often commissioned works of art in their respective countries or summoned architects, sculptors and painters. The main goal of this project is to track down those artists who came from abroad as well as those going out from Croatia and to analyse the origins of the forms and functions of architecture built from late antiquity to the late middle ages. The understanding of the transformation of the Roman world in late antiquity and the early middle Ages, the need to track those changes in a longer time span, even within the growth of the medieval feudal society and to explain the role of the elites becomes fundamental. To answer those questions large field surveys will be carried on as well as the research of elites as investors and carriers of ideas, forms and functions of ecclesiastical architecture. The team is divided in working groups covering different historical regions of Croatia, submitted to very different influences during the middle ages, as well as covering different chronological sequences. By means of thorough field survey, creating catalogue data of architecture, sculpture and painting, through comparative analysis the goal will be achieved. 					 				|	|Art history|	|Late antiquity, middle ages, architecture, sculpture, painting, forms, functions, artistic transfers, historical landscape|

The applied goal of the project is to create a metaphorical language database ? the Croatian Metaphor Repository. The database will be available on the Internet. It will include the following levels: conceptual metaphors, linguistic metaphors, image schemas, cogs and frames. Metaphors will be divided by type (primary, complex and entailed metaphors), by level (general, specific), and by family (Event Structure Metaphors, Mind Metaphors, Morality Metaphors, Scalar Metaphors, Time Metaphors, Emotion Metaphors, Economics Metaphors, Governance Metaphors, Cascade Metaphors, Well-being Metaphors etc.). The theoretical background for the linguistic analysis of conceptual metaphors is the Neural Theory of Language and Thought and the Neural Theory of Metaphor. Formal annotation tools are taken from embodied construction grammar. Both theoretical research and the creation of the repository will significantly advance Croatian cognitive and computational linguistics, artificial intelligence studies and the research of language and learning processes. The database will allow for generalizations and will become a very useful tool for cross-linguistic and cross-cultural research of metaphor and thought leading to further development of the theory and the field and to understanding how people learn, understand, and use language. The project has significant potential for further international development. 					 				|	|Philology|	|conceptual metaphor, image schemas, frames, metonymy, metaphor in natural language processing and artificial intelligence|

Vanja Flegar|	|We hereby submit to the HRZZ the project “Croatian philosophy and science in the European context between the 12th and 20th century” for financial support. Due to the integrative nature of the modern world, the primary issue for each member of the European and global community is the preservation of its identity, which implies cherishing national culture and the inherent philosophical and scientific tradition. Croatia’s accession to the EU has imposed an even stronger need for preservation. Research into Croatian philosophy and science started at the turn of the 20th century, but to re-examine national identity each generation inevitably has to revert to tradition, which is why studies of the works of Croatian philosophers and scientists should be our permanent mission. Continuing the work of previous researchers, our desire is to analyse the still unexplored aspects of Croatian philosophy and science in order to gain better insight into their contribution to European philosophy and science. That is why this project plans to tackle the following topics: “Reception of Plato’s philosophy in the works of Croatian philosophers between the 12th and 16th century”; “The development and shifts in Aristotelianism during the 16th and 17th century”; “The philosophy of Juraj Dragišić”; “Croatian aesthetics and poetics in the European context between the 16th and 18th century”; “The relationship between natural philosophy and alchemy in the works of Croatian authors Andrija Dudić, Pavle Skalić, and Frane Petrić”; “The alchemy in Croatia from 14th to 18th”century; “The history of Croatian chemistry during the development of natural sciences in the 19th and 20th century”; “A review of the history of Croatian philosophy in the 19th and 20th century”. The aim of this project is an anthology that would present the results of four years of research and serve as the basis for creating a comprehensive overview of the entire history of Croatian philosophy and science. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|Croatian philosophy, history of philosophy, history of science, natural sciences,aesthetics, Neo-Platonism, Aristotelianism, alchemy, postmodern|

Rural areas account for almost 90% of the land and are home to almost half of the population, both in Croatia and the EU. They are still the most important food production zones in Europe, although this primary function has been challenged by numerous modernization and globalization processes and complemented by other economic, social, cultural, and environmental functions. As a result, we have witnessed the (re)emergence of heterogeneous and diversified rural areas, juxtaposing depopulation and land abandonment in some regions, and tourist development or agricultural intensification in others. Given their size, population number, functions and variety of challenges they face, the question of future of rural areas is one of the most pressing issues in Europe today. This is evident from recent scenario-based approaches to study future trends and driving forces for rural Europe, both in academic and political discourse, on national and EU level (e.g. SCENAR 2020, EURURALIS etc.). On the other hand, although the majority of rural areas in Croatia face tremendous demographic and economic challenges, to our knowledge no scenario-based research has been done and only a few partial impact analyses have been conducted in recent Croatian agricultural policy. Therefore, the main objectives of the CRORURIS study are as follows: 1. to develop a conceptual framework for understanding recent change in rural Croatia; 2. to develop methodological framework for identifying predominant trends and key uncertainties, differentiating them geographically and projecting them forward using statistical modelling and Delphi method; 3. to construct alternative future scenarios and relate them to the context of rural Europe. 					 				|	|Economy|	|scenario, rural areas, typology, planning, modelling, Delphi, Croatia|

Four of the Zagreb Archaeological Museum’s departments have an extremely large number of artefacts from this period found in this particular region, most of which remain unpublished and require a thorough scientific assessment. Therefore, the main emphasis of the project would be on the study and publication of the material kept in the holdings of the Museum. The principal results of the CEMS project would be to publish up to ten monographs on the archaeological and numismatic heritage of the Middle Danube region within a given time frame. These publications would not merely be catalogues of material but would aim to present, following modern methodological approaches in archaeology, ancient history and numismatics, all the cultural, social, economical, monetary and technological transformations that occurred over that fascinating period in a defined geographical area. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Middle Danube region, Pannonia, Roman archaeology, numismatics, La Tene period, Archaeological museum in Zagreb|

From the 18 to the 19th C the revolution in natural, human and technical sciences marks the beginning of modern society and contemporary approach in arts and architecture. Although Grand Tour originally focused on Rome, the exploration of the Ancient World as the origin of Neolassicism widened its travelling radius onto further parts of the Roman Empire, among which Dalmatia held a prominent position. Drawings and literary works by travel artists and writers from that period are treasured in prestigious European museums and libraries and together constitute a priceless portion of European cultural heritage. For the first time, all known travelogues and drawings about Dalmatia from that period will be collected, analysed and evaluated in terms of literary theory and theory of architecture. The overall aim of the project is to identify, problematise and integrate the issues related to the phenomenon of recording the space, predominantly in Dalmatia. The specific goals of the project are: establishing a working group of young researchers; raising issues of international relevance related to description of Dalmatian space based on works of the 18th and 19th C artists and writers; advancing the development of research methodology; making applicable the research of contemporary cultural-spatial context for critical rethinking in contemporary approach to architecture; creating a platform for further research at international level; establishing a dissemination channel towards both European scientific circles and wider audience. In three years of research the following will be realised: the research of archival records; field research; project webpage; three international workshops; international scientific conference; public lectures; scientific papers and on-line proceeding book of workshops and conference. 					 				|	|Art history|	|Grand Tour, Dalmatia, Neoclassicism and Romanticism, Representation of Place, Contemporary Urbanscape|

More precisely, research will explore decisions made by individuals with different levels of decision-making autonomy and authority in the profit and non-profit organizations in the process of fulfilling their mission, as well as decisions of individuals in the process of satisfying their personal and family needs and wants. The findings will serve to encourage satisfaction providing, socially responsible decision-making that increases value for all stakeholders included directly and indirectly in the co-creation process. There is a number of research questions that need to be addressed in order to achieve the research goal. The crucial ones are: 1. Which factors determine the decision-making process of individuals involved in the buying and selling centres of profit and non-profit business entities that participate in value co-creation on B2B market? 2. Which factors determine the decision-making process of individuals involved in the selling centres of profit and non-profit business entities and individuals who act as buyers in value co-creation on B2C market? The scientific contribution and originality of this research derives from the fact that it will be conducted within the framework of value co-creation. Moreover, its originality is supported by the project team’s joint efforts in applying both classical marketing methods and those applied in neuroscience. It is expected that these complex research approaches will result in acquiring new knowledge that will significantly contribute to management operating on B2B and B2C markets. Furthermore, the results are expected to pinpoint the importance of good quality cooperation of partners with a paradigm shift to value co-creation in the exchange process as to create long-term business relationship based on mutual satisfaction. 					 				|	|Economy|	|decision making, value, co-creation, marketing, B2B market, B2C market|

Repeated drug taking leads to neuroadaptations which over time affect neural networks and change behavior. One such change induced by drugs and commonly studied in lab animals is behavioral sensitization. Regulation of gene expression is one important mechanism by which drugs change the plasticity of the networks which regulate behavior. A group of transcriptional regulators of the molecular circadian clock have been identified to function as regulators of behavioral sensitization to cocaine in Drosophila. Subsequent studies in rodents proved the universality of those genes in mediating drug responses. The genetic pathways and molecular interactions through which circadian genes regulate drug responses has remained undefined. We hypothesize that new genes which interact with circadian genes in the regulation of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants can be identified in a genetic screen in Drosophila. This is a goal for which Drosophila is perfectly suited, because genetic screens aimed at defining new genes can be performed relatively easy, fast and cheap. Our first aim is to devise a high-throughput method for measuring behavioral sensitization in flies by modifying the existing method for measuring activity. Second, we will undertake a directed behavioral screen by pre-selecting candidates with reported molecular interaction with circadian genes. In the third aim we will use transgenic flies and other genetic tools to investigate neural mechanisms involved in behavioral sensitization. The proposed research is innovative and relevant for human health. New gene candidates isolated in this screen could easily be translated into mammalian research where they will help in further understanding of neuroplastic changes induced by psychostimulants. Given our expertise and available resources the project has great potential to advance the field. 					 				|	|Biology|	|addiction, psychostimulants, Drosophila, circadian, genes, screen|

Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, and time of introduction of invasive species is essential for assessing the threats. Warming is expected to force species to shift their distributions by expanding into new climatic areas. Several projects have shown that genotypes have increasingly migrated to the north in the last decade, mainly caused by climate change. Records of changes as a result of pest-host-climate change interaction, including possible reasons for changes, are a crucial point of forest monitoring which forms the basis for control strategies and forest management decisions. We will build case studies to represent a specific pest-host-climate change interaction model: native and potentially invasive: i) from one isolated population to other population, (Gypsy Moth); ii) from one climate/geographic region to another (Abraxas pantaria) and non-native potentially invasive in a new climate/geographic region (Cydalima perspectalis). The study presents an extensive research on targeted insect pests in Croatia, taking into account the biology of the pest and host plants and all aspects of the bioecology of the species like genetic constitution and origin, thermal requirements, possible host plants, palatability, influence of antagonists etc.) that influence its spread in a novel environment influenced by climate change and possible serious damage. All the gained data could be used for predictive pest risk analysis models for the researched species, as well as for other native and non-native invasive species that could become a serious threat to Croatian forest ecosystems in changed climate conditions in the near future. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|invasive forest pests, climate change, biodiversity, insect pathology, Lymantria dispar, Abraxas pantaria,Cydalima perspectalis|

Whilst it is recognized that there are justified reasons for acquisition and sharing videos in manners such as security, bio-terrorism surveillance applications, low enforcement and forensics, there is also a strong need for protecting the privacy of the guiltless individuals who are inevitably captured in the recordings. Video surveillance is privacy intrusive because it allows the observation of certain information that is considered privacy intrusive. Face has central role in the process of human recognition and identification in videos, thus the special attention has to be devoted to the face de-identification methods for privacy protection. De-identification addresses, in context of our project, the automated methods of concealing or/and removing face identifiers of individuals captured in videos. The importance of privacy protection is mirrored in documents such as UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and EU’s Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) as well as commissioned review of the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) by the EU Information Commissioner’s Office from July 2008. The general public has become increasingly aware of the potential danger for their personal data to be abused. Beside scientific objectives and goals (robust face localization, novel methods for face de-identification in videos, preserving data utility and naturalness in de-identification videos, privacy protection), the main objectives of the proposed project are human resources (early stage researchers and PhD students) development by transfer of knowledge in the fields of advanced technologies to carry out problem-oriented research, and increasing a competitiveness level of the research team for Horizon 2020 project applications. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|privacy protection, biometric identification, de-identification, surveillance systems, video|

This capability is now widely exploited in a variety of scenarios to obtain audio-video recordings of people, raising serious privacy concerns. The protection of sensitive private data is required by EU’s Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). De-identification in multimedia content can be defined as the process of concealing identities of individuals captured in a given set of data, for the purpose of protecting their privacy. Soft biometric and non-biometric characteristics such as tattoos, birthmarks, scars or dressing style also carry potentially identity-revealing information and have to be dealt with in the process of de-identification. This is an interdisciplinary challenge, involving such scientific areas as image processing, video tracking and biometrics.

OP compounds used as pesticides account for over 3,000,000 registered accidental or deliberate cases of poisoning per year worldwide. Furthermore, OPs known as nerve agents (soman, sarin, tabun, VX) present a threat in terrorist attacks and conflicts, as was the case recently in Syria. The main targets of OP compounds are cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the essential enzyme in neurotransmission, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), its back-up enzyme. However, the antidotes currently in use, which act as reactivators of inhibited AChE, were empirically synthesized before the two enzyme’s crystal structures were resolved. Due to structural requirements, their binding affinity and reactivation rate have not been well-balanced. This project utilizes new compounds to gain a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of the limitations of reactivation and find new effective leads for further in vivo study. We will combine several approaches, including: a study of the finely tuned interplay between these two sister enzymes, computational and experimental studies of cholinesterase interactions with a wide range of ligands defining favourable characteristic for potential new antidotes, in silico design of novel compounds that will direct the subsequent synthesis of selected leads, and thorough in vitro and in vivo experimental evaluation guided by strict cost-benefit criteria. Such a comprehensive approach will enable us to test a wide selection of candidates in a more reliable manner and obtain unambiguous data for further enhancements of the antidotal treatment. This will also enable us to explore other possible OP treatments such as highly-effective bioscavengers. Many of the findings that would arise from this project should have an impact that reaches far beyond the level of cholinesterases. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, bioscavengers, prophylaxis, in silico drug-design, oximes, bronchodilatators|

The number and share of high-growth enterprises is relatively small, but the number and share of jobs they create is disproportionally large. The small and medium enterprises with the potential of growth are in the focus of this project. Two overarching goals of this project are: 1. Development of growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia The main activities leading up to this goal are: (i) to analyse previous studies relevant for the topic of SMEs' growth potential; (ii) to develop growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia; (iii) to make the models for assessing growth potential available to SMEs to use for purposes of assessing and improving their businesses; (iv) to compare differences in growth potential among SMEs from main industries; (v) to analyse growth potential of SMEs within creative industries and within manufacturing industries. 2. Providing recommendations to policy makers, recommendation for development of educational programs for SME owners and managers, and recommendations related to sources of finance available to SMEs Based on the research results and models created as part of this project, the main recommendations related to growth potential of SMEs will cover areas of: (i) policy making; (ii) education; and (iii) sources of finance. In recent years policy makers have shown increased interest in fostering fast growing enterprises as they are seen as a key driver of economic growth and employment. Studies conducted in listed companies have showed that two key aspects in supporting high-growth companies are education and access to finance. To allow for comparison of other countries with Croatia, results of this project will be published in relevant scientific journals. To help boost Croatian economy, the results will be presented to all stakeholders interested in this topic. 					 				|	|Economy|	|prediction of growth potential, high-growth SMEs, creative industry, policy recommendation for high growth SMEs, access to finance for high-growth SME|

In the meantime, technology advancements, cost reduction and governmental incentives have made some renewable energy sources more competitive in the market. Among them, wind energy is the one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources. The conversion of the wind energy into electric energy is of a multidisciplinary nature, involving aerodynamics, mechanical systems, electric machines, power electronics, control theory, and power systems. The main goal of this project is to establish new research group which will improve the quality, performance and competitiveness of industrial sector in the field of wind power generation. The research group has already participated in the project for the development of advanced control structures for induction generator connected via back-to-back-converter to the grid in wind turbine application. As a step forward in innovation, research and development the research focus is set on permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMG) parameter identification, estimation of PMG rotor position using high frequency signal injection and speed estimation. Also, focus is on energy efficient based control method such as model predictive control of PMG. Advanced sensorless control algorithms for PMG will be developed and experimentally verified on the industrial laboratory model. Basic infrastructure for implementation and verification of developed algorithms exists in the Laboratory and for testing of advanced control structures on PMG laboratory model needs to be further upgraded. The final result will be the capability of research group for future cooperation with industrial partners for development of wind power generator systems and other generation systems. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|permanent magnet generator, wind power generation, back-to-back converter, energy efficiency, sensorless control,|

In general, shielding analyses can be classified into two categories: preliminary analyses and final analyses. Preliminary analysis can be conducted using computer codes based on engineering methods, the most used one based on point-kernel method. Recent research indicated that a new approach can be used in determination of buildup factors as the key parameters of point-kernel method. The approach is based on machine learning technique, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR). For efficient training of the SVR models of a complex physical problem, an active learning procedure has to be defined. Final shielding analysis is usually conducted by computer codes based on either deterministic or statistic methods placing high time and hardware demands, but resulting in more accurate results. Advanced numerical procedures utilize advantages of both, deterministic approach as well as stochastic approach resulting in a hybrid deterministic-stochastic procedure increasing the efficiency of the overall analysis. The overall objective of the proposed project is the development of the synthesized calculational tool to enable all stages of a shield design to be performed within integrated environment. To accomplish this objective following activities are planned: definition of the optimal active learning procedure in regression framework to prepare data sets for SVR model creation, investigation of gamma and neutron buildup factors and preparation of SVR models, development of the computational tool for preliminary stage shielding design, optimization of hybrid deterministic-stochastic numerical procedure, development of the control module for automatic shielding analyses process control, preparation of front-end and back-end interface, testing of the final shielding analysis environment. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|machine learning, active learning, parallel and distributed computing, gamma shielding, neutron shielding|

Besides its primary purpose, land administration system can and should also serve as a basis for land management. Different to the land administration, land management is a set of processes ensuring that the land is used in an efficient and sustainable manner. Unfortunately, land administration systems are rarely able to fulfill such additional requirements, even in the developed countries. This project aims at finding what needs to be done in order to transform a traditional land administration system into a modern multipurpose land administration system (MLAS), which can efficiently support land management. Our hypothesis says that such a transformation can be done by improving two aspects of a LAS, its efficiency and its usability. Under efficiency we consider the ability of a LAS to update its data quickly whilst ensuring the consistency and correctness thereof. Within the project we will investigate options for outsourcing the preparation of transactions to private sector and the possibilities to more efficiently collect field data within the improved process of updating LAS data. Even more important that its efficiency, is the usability of a LAS. This is the second aspect that we try to improve within the project. Besides the mere registration of the land, MLAS must be able to efficiently support processes of land valuation, urban planning and various rearrangements aiming to increase agricultural productivity of the land. Within the project we will investigate which additional data needs to be collected, processed and stored within the LAS in order to enable efficient support to land management processes. As a starting point for the research we use our previous research closely related to the topics of land administration and land management, and the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), which recently became the ISO standard. 					 				|	|Geodesy|	|Land Administration System, Land Registers, Land Management, Sustainable Development, Geoinformation|

The conventional choice, organosphosphates and pyrethroids, has many disadvantages due to considerable hazard of harmful residues, high cost, and the possible and already present appearance of insect resistance. The possible alternative, diatomaceous earth (DE), because of the needs to use high concentrations to control insects, is hindered by its effect on grain flow, bulk density and very high cost. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of a new, less toxic and less dangerous insecticide(s) to control insect pests of stored food and in Public Health/Pest Control field. Synergism of DE and botanicals allows effective control with much lower concentrations of active ingredients, in comparison when these components are used separately. The mode of action is a synergistic combination of desiccation, poisoning and (probably) starvation. Croatia has several sources of DE that are still not in use. These DEs have a potential to be used as natural insecticides or combining it with other natural substances to develop safe, effective and natural insecticide. Also, Croatia has a botanical diversity of indigenous plants. However, the country has not yet benefited from this wealth of knowledge on the use of plants as pesticides. These results make us confident that there is a possibility to develop the new natural synergized insecticide formulation(s) using Croatian DE and plant extract. The proposed project fits the goals and strategic priorities CSF because it encourages the international competitiveness of research groups,developing scientific field that provides the technological advances applicable to agriculture, food industry, public health, communal hygiene and veterinary medicine as well as the ability to obtain new Croatian natural products. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|natural insecticides, inert dusts, botanical insecticides, stored pest, stored products|

The main goal of this proposal is to develop novel polymer nanocomposites of extending photoactivity toward visible region under UV/VIS light irradiation and to introduce an innovative technology for water purification. The conducting polymers (CPs) are known as good hole conducting materials1 and are combined with semiconductor nanoparticles to produce a synergistic effect and complementary properties. Due to that Polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conducting polymers will be studied with metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO) nanoparticles to develop polymer nanocomposite photocatalysts (CPNPs) with enhanced photocatalytic properties. The optimal structure-properties relationships are crucial for efficient degradation of organic contaminants in water to convert them into harmless chemicals. Novel CPNPs will be applied in photocatalytic degradation of organic azo dyes (reactive red 45 and methyl orange) chosen as targeted wastewater pollutants. The utilization of waste material, fly ash, as a catalyst support will be explored to provide the additional environmental benefit. The proposed integral approach that will be used in the evaluation of the process efficiency will scrutinize any negative implications of CPNPs application. The project will contribute to the development and modernization of science and technology in Croatia, advancing toward the knowledge-based society within the European research area. Project includes a multidisciplinary effort, ranging from polymer science and technology, chemistry and environmental chemistry to electrochemical engineering, in order to meet challenging project tasks and propose an efficient photocatalytic polymer nanocomposite for sustainable water treatment technology. 1.

The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion. Antioxidant is a foreign substance that reacts with the oxidant faster than the components of the cell. An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favour of the oxidants is termed oxidative stress. Antioxidants act as free radical scavengers and therefore can lower the risk of numerous degenerative diseases by preventing damages caused by free radicals. Fruits and vegetables are the major sources of antioxidants in human diet. Several natural compounds found in food, such as polyphenols, vitamins A and E, and some carotenoids, have been found to show excellent antioxidant activity. Chlorophylls and their derivatives have also been reported to possess this activity. However, literature is still scarce regarding their antioxidant properties. It is known that the amount of each antioxidant in fruits, vegetables and their derivatives is strongly influenced by numerous factors such as agro-technical processes, environmental conditions, processing factors and storage conditions. Continuous monitoring of antioxidant capacity of plant-based foods through different phases, from cultivation to storage, is needed to maintain or even improve the beneficial properties of food. The goal of this project is to develop several cyclic multi-pulse voltammetric techniques for the characterization of natural antioxidants and to apply them in routine analysis of food quality. Experimental results will be explained by the comparison with the theoretical simulation of responses of various electrode mechanisms of independent and conjugated multiple redox centers. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|voltammetry, antioksidans, radicals, squave wave, simulations|

One of the main topics of research in this project will be Diophantine m-tuples (sets with the property that the product of its any two distinct elements increased by 1 is a perfect square) and their generalizations. The first Diophantine quadruple {1,3,8,120} was found by Fermat. Baker and Davenport proved that Fermat's set cannot be extended to a quintuple. This result motivated the famous conjecture that there does not exist a Diophantine quintuple. Dujella proved that there does not exist a Diophantine sextuple and that there are only finitely many Diophantine quintuples. Recently, Filipin, Fujita and Elsholtz significantly improved previously known upper bounds for the number of Diophantine quintuples, but the main conjecture still remains open. Various generalizations of Diophantine m-tuples will be studied, in particular, considering the problem in the rings of integers of number fields of small degree. Diophantine triples were used by Dujella in construction of high-rank elliptic curves over Q and Q(T) and new results in that direction are expected. In determining exactly the Mordell-Weil group of several elliptic curves over Q(T), an important tool is recent algorithm by Gusić and Tadić for finding rationals at which the specialization map is injective. We plan to improve and extend this algorithm for elliptic curves over K(T) for general number fields K. Members of the group will also work on Thue, Thue-Mahler and index forms equations, problems related to sums of divisors, polynomial root separation and applications of Diophantine approximations to cryptanalysis. The results of the research will be published in respectable journals and presented on international conferences. Through this project we will intensify our scientific connections with international number-theorists and qualify young researchers for scientific research in number theory. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Diophantine equations, elliptic curves, Diophantine approximations, polynomials, cryptography|

In the 1990s, Vogan conjectured a strengthening of Parthasarathy's Dirac inequality, which relates the cohomology of the Dirac operator to the infinitesimal character of the representation. This conjecture was proved in a joint paper with Huang . In further research, in part joint with various collaborators (Barbasch, Huang, Kang, Mehdi, Protsak, Renard, Somberg, Zhu) , we related Dirac cohomology to other kinds of cohomology, calculated it explicitly for many interesting representations, and studied algebraic Dirac induction, a construction of representations with given Dirac cohomology. The proposed project will continue this research in several directions: 1) the study of representations obtained by Dirac induction, in particular the discrete series representations (doctoral research of Ana Prlić). 2) applying Dirac cohomology to problems of restricting representations. Some instances of this have been studied with Huang-Zhu and with Somberg. 3) trying to strengthen the Dirac inequality, which should have implications for the study of unitary representations. Some preliminary work on the convex hull conjecture of Salamanca-Vogan has been done with Renard. 4) calculating the Dirac cohomology of unipotent representations. Some cases of this have been obtained jointly with Barbasch. This could lead to better understanding of characters of unipotent representations, which is related to the Assem conjecture. It would also be interesting to calculate the Dirac cohomology of unitary highest weight modules. Other topics we plan to cover include studying translation principle for Dirac index (joint with Mehdi and Vogan); studying n-cohomology and BGG resolutions using Penrose transforms (joint with Soucek); studying some abstract homotopy and homology theory, with applications to tensor categories of representations (doctoral research of Matija Bašić). 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Harish-Chandra modules, Dirac operators, cohomology, Dirac induction, branching problems|

For decades, chestnut blight, a disease caused by one of the world´s most aggressive invasive pathogens Cryphonectria parasitica has been causing high mortality in chestnut forest populations and orchards. However, the fungus can be controlled by the naturally-occurring virus Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1) which causes a reduction in fungal virulence and sporulation (a phenomenon called hypovirulence), which in turn enables infected trees to recover. Hypovirulence is the most efficient way to successfully control chestnut blight in Europe, but unfortunately the spread of CHV-1 is limited by the fungal diversity and its sexual reproduction. This project aims at revealing individual and joint aspects of the dynamic three-lateral interaction between chestnut, its fungal pathogen and the pathogen-biocontrol agent-virus. The proposed study will: (1) reveal the diversity of natural chestnut populations in south-eastern Europe, (2) connect the sequences and 3-D structures of CHV1 subtype I proteins with the level of fungal hypovirulence, (3) reveal the role of epigenetic changes of fungal genome in respect to hypovirus infection and geographical spread of the fungus (4) assess the efficiency of naturally-occurring virus isolates to induce chestnut recovery in natural conditions. The results will also contribute to the combat efforts against chestnut blight in the field conditions, by enabling production of therapeutic paste for induction of recovery in a valuable chestnut cultivar. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|biological control, chestnut disease, epigenetics, hypovirulence, molecular ecology|

The RecA protein is a key component of recombinational systems in bacteria. Its homologs are also present in higher organisms including humans. RecA functions in the form of nucleoprotein filaments that are assembled on single-stranded DNA, and which catalyze pairing and strand exchange between two homologous DNA duplexes. In Escherichia coli, the RecBCD and RecFOR protein complexes mediate RecA filament assembly, and consequently, play an important role in recombination. We have recently discovered that some E. coli mutants recombine quite efficiently in the absence of both RecBCD and RecFOR complexes. This recombination is RecA-dependent suggesting the existence of an alternative RecA loading activity. The aim of the project is to genetically characterize this RecBCD- RecFOR-independent (RecBFI) recombination pathway, and gain insight into this novel mechanism of RecA filament assembly. Although RecA is crucial for efficient recombination in bacteria, the recA mutants of radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans display a significant residual ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Recent results from our group have shown that this RecA-independent repair is quite inaccurate leading to gross chromosome rearrangements. Our project is to identify the key genes/proteins involved in this RecA-independent repair, and to characterize, at the sequence level, gross genome rearrangements in D. radiodurans. Given that recombination is a fundamental process largely conserved during evolution, our research on bacteria may reveal molecular mechanisms that are applicable to eukaryotic recombination systems. Thus, the results of our project could be instructive for research on cancer and other human hereditary diseases related to defects in DNA recombination functions. 					 				|	|Biology|	|hommologous recombination, DNA repair, genome stability, Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, RecA protein, gross chromosomal rearrangements|

This Slavic vernacular, which was the direct predecessor of present-day Croatian, coexisted with the liturgical Croatian Church Slavic, whose oldest written texts can be dated to the 11th c. The earliest attestations of the Croatian language are scattered throughout written sources of various nature, from individual words found in Latin and Church Slavic texts, glosses, and notes in the margins of medieval codices to Glagolitic epigraphs. This language has not yet been analyzed in its entirety. The backbone of the project will be formed by a corpus of the earliest attested Croatian lexical data. Such a corpus does not yet exist. This early Croatian corpus will reflect the development of the languages between the 9th and 13th centuries, some of the earliest isoglosses between Croatian and other Slavic languages, as well as some of the earliest Croatian dialectal isoglosses and interaction with western European – especially Romance and Germanic – and eastern European cultural and linguistic entities. The earliest onomastic data of Slavic origin plays an important role in this research. The research will be conducted using the traditional methods and tools of historical linguistics, such as text analysis and interpretation and the comparative method. The research team consists of four researchers and five junior researchers from a number of academic institutions (Zagreb, Zadar, Leiden). The aims of the proposed project are: (1) to create a complete collection of the oldest attestations of the Croatian language; (2) to improve our understanding of the structural changes in early Croatian and the rise of the earliest isoglosses within Croatian; (3) to place the beginnings of the Croatian language in a wider Slavic and non-Slavic context. 					 				|	|Philology|	|Old Croatian, Proto-Slavic, onomastics, earliest linguistic attestations, loanwords, issogloses|

In order to accomplish this goal, good economic governance incorporating energy policy should implement reforms that will increase economic efficiency and social prosperity. The sector’s reform experience goes back to the beginning of 1990s, indicating that existing literature has been limited by a relatively short period of time, inadequate hypothesis cross-testing and without appropriate panel-data analysis. Therefore there is a strong need for the systematic analysis that would include EU countries and Croatia as the new EU Member State, a broader range of issues related to energy sector reforms within a longer time frame to examine whether the empirical evidence supports the logic of reforms and to compare the existing evidence on the reform determinants and performance. So far the findings on some issues have been limited and inconclusive. The goal of the research is to better understand the reform process by providing solid economic evidence on energy reform results and its economic and social impacts on sustainable growth. The aim of the research within this project is to address several related issues: 1) internal and external factors that will further influence the progress of reforms, especially in the EU; 2) macroeconomic performance, institutional settings, regulatory prudence and sector governance as the important wider framework; 3) measuring the economic impact of energy reforms in terms of economic efficiency, rate of investments, competitiveness and economic growth; 4) testing the existing risk management models and developing a novel approach to assessing and hedging the risks in the energy market; 5) measuring the social impact of energy reforms in terms of coverage of energy services and welfare; 6) evaluation of the energy reforms impact on long-term and sustainable economic growth. The research will be performed by combining economic and technical approach and research methods. 					 				|	|Economy|	|energy sector, reforms, economic effects, social effects, sustainable economic growth, Croatia, European Union|

Therefore in this research we investigate the features of the sovereign bond markets that are either underexplored or the literature offers conflicting findings. We focus specifically on bond markets in all EU member states and the US, and differentiate seven research segments that are mutually interrelated. First segment applies GARCH-type models and estimates sovereign bond spread volatility and the volatility risk premium. The output of this segment is used in subsequent segments; in the model of spread determinants, volatility spillovers, and capital flight. Second segment is dedicated to the analysis of the statistical properties of sovereign spreads volatility by an application of extreme value theory, self-exciting and Markov switching models. We quantify extremal dependence between spreads and the distribution of clusters of their extreme movements using the extremogram. Two segments are devoted to the analysis of volatility spillovers across bond markets and time-varying degree of sovereign bond market integration in developed and emerging EU countries. We also analyze political factors that may influence the sovereign bond market and cross-border capital movement. In this segment we code political variables employed as explanatory variables in the remaining two segments. Hence segment six estimates the model of spread determinants that includes a more balanced and detailed representation of market sentiment and volatility, fiscal features, and political factors. Due to the fact that in recent times extreme changes in sovereign bond markets induced cross-border reallocation of the capital, in the seventh segment we estimate a capital flight model that includes political factors and sovereign spread volatility premium. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Sovereign bond market, sovereign spreads, volatility spillovers, sovereign bond market integration stochastic volatility models, extreme value theory,|

Jonathan Ashwell|	|Mutations in a widely expressed ubiquitin-binding protein optineurin were recently found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease of unresolved pathogenesis. Unlike most of the other mutated proteins known to cause ALS by their toxic prion-like properties, optineurin is largely thought to cause disease by loss-of-function, arguing for its protective role. In vitro studies proposed that it regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell signaling, autophagy and vesicle trafficking, but their link to neurodegeneration is unknown. ALS is not an autonomous disease of selected neurons. Glial cells including microglia, are essential for neuroinflammation, which greatly shapes disease progression. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the exact role(s) whereby optineurin exerts neuroprotection, pinpoint the cell types in which it acts, and determine its putative effect(s) on the interactions between the cell types relevant for neurodegeneration. We aim to dissect these questions in a stepwise fashion by (1) assessing cell-intrinsic functions in neurons, microglia and macrophages, (2) addressing crosstalk in mix-and-match co-cultures and organotypic spinal cord slices, and (3) verifying these findings in mice. To this end, we have generated a novel disease-mimicking genetic mouse model of optineurin insufficiency. Analyzing the function of optineurin in primary cells and mice models is crucial to the success of this study, given that ubiquitin-binding proteins are prone to in vitro artifacts. Incomplete understanding of ALS pathogenesis is directly mirrored in almost complete inability to treat ALS patients: a single approved drug exerts only a small prolongation in survival. Here, we propose to study a unique ALS model, set apart from the currently available models of direct toxicity by its ability to provide insight into basic neuroprotective mechanisms, thus expectedly paving the way for more successful therapies. 					 				|	|Biology|	|cell signalling, autophagy, microglia, neurodegeneration, animal models|

However, there is still a great need for new solids with ‘improved’ physical properties (faster, cheaper, smarter or more responsive than current alternatives). Unfortunately, the ability to ‘dial-in’ a property or physical response remains a major challenge. Therefore, our goal is to establish reliable avenues for the design of crystalline metal-containing materials by encoding building-blocks with structural-preferences that lead to ‘programmable’ assembly, thus avoiding serendipity and chance when targeting new materials with specific and tunable properties. To achieve this, we first need to map out the structural landscape that controls how metal complexes communicate and subsequently assemble into 3-D architectures. We will explore and quantify the interrelationship between ligand-field splitting energy, coordination geometry, metal-ligand dimensionality, ligand flexibility, and supramolecular assembly, one variable at a time, using a combination of experiment and theory. This will enable us to map out the structural landscape defined by metal(II) complexes (Co, Ni, Cu and Cd) and custom-made ligands decorated with functionalities that are known to form reliable supramolecular synthons in organic solids. New structural and spectroscopic information will be complemented by data obtained by mining the CSD, while computational methods will inform both the planning as well as the interpretation of the experimental efforts. The results obtained in this systematic and multidisciplinary research program will create new avenues towards the design of crystalline metal-containing materials based on reliable structure-activity protocols. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|crystal engineering, non-covalent interactions, supramolecular architecture, synthons, metal complexes|

Thus, the development of advanced treatment technologies is highly required. Technologies using nanomaterials are one of the fast-growing fields creating variety of new commercial nanoparticles. One of the innovative applications of nanomaterials with a great potential involve their usage as water treatment tools. The photocatalytic treatment using nano-TiO2 as a destructive and “zero” waste method for water purification provides a synergy of advanced oxidation technologies and nanomaterials application with a great potential to be commercialized. However, some features of TiO2 photocatalysis, its mechanical and chemical stability, have to be improved to minimize the potential negative implications. The main goal of NanoWaP project is to develop the sustainable photo-AOT with nanocomposite photocatalysts for the purification of water containing pharmaceuticals. In order to overcome the limitations of nano-TiO2 technologies: agglomeration tendency, post-separation, low activation potential under the sunlight, novel nano-TiO2-based composites with iron-exchanged zeolites and SnS2 will be investigated for degradation of pharmaceuticals in water. The efficiency will be evaluated using an innovative integral approach including: (i) pharmaceuticals removal expressed in a terms of common ecological parameters, (ii) energy consumption per decreased concentration of chosen ecological parameter for one order of magnitude, and (iii) the assessment of adverse environmental effects. Besides, the photocatalysts characterization prior and after the treatment would provide an additional insight in its stability which will be also examined through consecutive runs. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|Water treatment, Advanced oxidation technologies, Photocatalysis, Pharmaceuticals degradation, Nanocomposites, Toxicity|

Despite aggressive treatment of HNSCC patients, which entails surgery, chemo- and radio-therapy, the five-year survival is only 40-50%. Tobacco, alcohol, microbial factors (high-risk human papillomaviruses, hrHPVs), systemic factors (immunosuppression, micronutrient deficiency) and UV-radiation are common risk factors for development of HNSCC. HNSCC patients with HPV infection were found to have better prognosis and treatment response. Besides the HPV status, no adequate biomarkers have been found so far to predict the poor/good clinical outcome nor is the mechanism of how HPV modulates therapy response fully understood. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation of specific gene promoters and posttranscriptional modification of gene expression by specific microRNA (miRNA) seems to be promising biomarkers of disease occurrence and progression. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to identify novel specific epigenetic biomarkers to predict early-stage of HNSCC, notably oral and oropharyngeal cancer, patients at greater risk for developing invasive cancer, and finally understand treatment response in patient with HPV-associated cancers. State-of-the-art technologies, wide-genome microarray assay and types-specific validation of DNA methylation and miRNA profiles (methylome and mirome, respectively) will be used on subsets of healthy tissue, HPV-related and HPV-unrelated precancerous oral lesions, oral and oropharyngeal cancer, and metastasis. The integration of all findings should yield ideal epigenetic biomarkers. This project is a comprehensive interdisciplinary research, which includes basic and clinical research, and will enable the improvement of existing knowledge, development of new technological approaches in diagnostics and prognostics, and possible new treatment approach for oral and oropharyngeal cancer. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|methylation, microRNA, HPV, head and neck cancer, biomarker|

(dipl.)) Genadij Razdorov,(mag. (dipl.)) Toma Keser|	|IgG is one of the main effectors of the immune system. Contrary to antigen binding properties which are defined by nucleotide sequence for its Fab part, effector functions of IgG are mostly regulated by Fc glycosylation, which is regulated by complex interplay of dozens of genes in the IgG glycosylation pathway and different environmental factors. Different clones of B lymphocytes have defined patterns of glycosylation, indicating temporal stability in the glycosylation pathway. DNA CpG methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification and is thus the most prominent candidate for “fixation” of the IgG glycosylation profile in different clones. Our past and current genome wide association studies (GWAS) are identifying complex genetic network which regulates IgG glycosylation. In this project we will use several complementary experimental approaches to identify genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms which regulate IgG glycosylation. IgG glycosylation is relevant in numerous diseases, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Several epigenetic drugs are already used to treat cancer, and many others are developing. Understanding of the role of the epigenetic regulation in IgG glycosylation will provide new targets for the development of new epigenetic drugs and new biomarkers for patient stratification. 					 				|	|Biology|	|DNA methylation, Epigenetics, Histone modifications, IgG, Protein glycosylation, TALENS|

It analyzes it regarding the systems of knowledge or epistemological matrixes and predominant hermeneutic paradigms in the context of European and Anglo-American literary historiography. Research period is delimited by the year 1913, when one of the first overall synthesis of the Croatian literature was published (B. Vodnik, Povijest hrvatske književnosti), and the year 1980, when the first anthropologically implemented theories of literature occur in our academic context. These two extremes, in the periodical sense, are thus interconnected, primarily because of the hermeneutic concepts announced by the early Croatian literary historians, s.a. Vodnik, Prohaska, Hergešić. The goals of this continuous research activity is to analyze: (1) dominant systems of knowledge significant for the development of Croatian literary historiography, s.a. positivism, folk-psychology, psychoanalysis in its Freudian sense, aestheticism, first phase of the responsive theories, applied sociology of literature, early Marxism, formalist, structuralist, stylistic criticism, early poststructuralism, anthropological tendencies; (2) dominant figures of Croatian literary historiography and their methods, derived from their published works, starting from B. Vodnik, D. Prohaska, T. Matić etc., all the way to I. Slamnig, Ž. Jeličić, M. Vaupotić, I. Frangeš, S. Lasić; (3) dominant figures of our literary historiography and their unpublished oeuvres (s.a. Vodnik, Kombol, Prohaska, Matković), which will be published in a critical form; (4) comparative context of this literary historiography, regarding dominant circles in the 20th century (s.a. Czech and Polish circle, Ljubljana school of literary history, German and Italian academic milieu and its influence on the Zagreb stylistics, French structuralism in Croatian milieu). 					 				|	|Philology|	|epistemology, literary history, theory of literary historiography, Marxist literary history, philological approach, textology, stylistic criticism|

Thus, monitoring forest productivity and understanding effects of key environmental drivers becomes essential for forest management. This is a challenging task, particularly due to great costs related to it. Hereby we propose a research, aimed at addressing this issue, with a novel approach that could facilitate fast and cost-effective assessments of forest productivity. The research would be conducted on pedunculate oak forests (Quercus robur L.) which are economically, and ecologically, one of the most important in Croatia. Main objective of the proposed research is to develop and test methods and workflows for the estimation of annual productivity of forests at the local scale by using existing research infrastructure for measurement of carbon fluxes (EC monitoring system), freely available high temporal resolution data from remote sensing (MODIS) and state of the art process model (Biome-BGC). The proposed research will provide the first evaluation on the quality of MODIS GPP and NPP estimates for Central-European lowland forests. Field measurement campaigns combined with state of the art digital photogrammetry will be performed to parameterise Biome-BGC model, and validate data from MODIS and model simulations. Using available data on future climate scenarion, productivity of oak forests for the future 30-50 years will be simulated with Biome-BGC model. The proposed research is in line with the objectives of the EU Forest Action Plan which, among others proposes to encourage adaptation to the effects of climate change (key action 6), and to work toward a European Forest Monitoring System (key action 8). 					 				|	|Forestry|	|forest productivity, Quercus robur, GPP, NPP, eddy covariance, MODIS, Biome-BGC, photogrammetry, dendrometers, soil respiration|

In the first phase of the project realisation, the participants would continue with the broadening and deepening of the theoretical basis of the „new European bioethics“ primarily by completing the research of the life and work of Fritz Jahr and his most important models (Ignaz Bregenzer and others). In the second phase of the project, three focused workshops would be organised determining the status of the general and special ecological needs for the three local communities (Plomin, Bakar, and Mali Lošinj) from the Northern Adriatic region. The three communities selected to host the workshops have either been recently experiencing ecological threats (Plomin – thermo-electric power plant; Bakar – cokery), or represent a highly-valuable and vulnerable natural insular pocket (Mali Lošinj – health tourism, dolphin wildlife refuge, fragrant gardens programme, etc.). Based on the theoretical background and the insights provided by the workshops, in the third phase of the project, created would be the „bioethical standards“, that is, a set of principles and measures of the correct relation of men toward their own health, animals, plants, and the eco-system in total. A „bioethical standards“ charter might improve the level of local community environmental consciousness, and provide direction lines for its sustainable development (including a potential tourism-advertising ace card). 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|Europe, integrative bioethics, Fritz Jahr, ecology, environment, Northern Adriatic|

Evliya Chelebi is the most famous Ottoman traveller and writer and the worldwide cited Ottoman author. His Seyahatname in Ottoman was recently published in Istanbul in ten volumes. For Croatian history the volumes V, VI and partly VII have the paramount significence.A critical edition and translation of the autograph’ssections of the books V, VI and VII into Croatian language does not exist. HazimŠabanović made translation on the basis of a printed version from 1900 which was done upon an inaccurate, even censored copy. The translator himself had shortened the narrative in many places. Even a brief insight in original text shows dramatical differences and alterations in quantity of text (there is up to 35 percent more text in the autograph) and quality of informations (substantially new informations, thoroughly different from those in Šabanović's translation). The aim of the project is to investigate this „missing link“ among the narrative sources for Croatian history in Early Modern Period, i.e. to scrutinize the autograph, to translate parts of the V, VI and VII book with commentaries and footnotes, and to produce supporting articles. A picture of Croatian societies in different political frames which is given in the Seyahatname has never been a subject of scholarly research. This would lead toward the comprehensive explanation and interpretation of early modern national integration, ecohistorical determinants, social and ethnoconfessional structures and processes. Such a project is expected to contribute substantially to filling the gaps in the historiography, to establish a more balanced perception of the past, along with the improvement of mutual understanding between Croatia and Turkey, with positive effect in the Southeastern Europe.

During the project we will explore open questions in the field of physical oceanography of the Adriatic Sea: (I) dynamics of the dense water (DW), especially flow at the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea, (II) dynamics of the Po river outflow during stratified and vertically homogeneous conditions, as well as (III) generation and dynamics of the sharp Istrian temperature and salinity front. In order to capture those phenomena we plan to use advanced field observations (ADCPs, CTDs, towed CTD profiler, underway ship CTD), as well as high resolution nested numerical models. This type of measurements could arguably prove hypothesis on the importance of the East Adriatic DW contribution to the overall northern Adriatic DW budget. Measuring synchronously at all important entrances of the Kvarner Bay, we can determine time-evolving dynamics of this socio-economically important region. ROMS 4D-Var system is a powerful tool capable to provide insight into a optimal observation setup, predictability and limits of the linearized adjoint techniques for a shelf sea as the Adriatic. Results from the project could serve as basis for other research fields like ocean biology (DW bringing O2 at the bottom), chemistry or geology, or even applied like oil spills, integrated environmental planning where correct dynamics is of a crucial importance. The project team members come from the four institutions: Ruđer Bošković Institute, Faculty of Science, Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service, and Hydrographic Institute bringing unique competences for the proposed project to succeed. Last but not least, it is important to emphasize that after the project completion, all the insitu collected and model data will be made available to the scientific and applied research community. 					 				|	|Geophysics|	|Physical Oceanography, Data Assimilation, 4D-Var, ADCP, CTD profiler, Po river dynamics, Dense Water Dynamics, Adriatic Sea|

The project would encompass five dipeptidyl peptidases III (DPP III): human, yeast, two bacterial orthologs, from thermophile Caldithrix abyssi and oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, and a DPP III from plant Physcomitrella patens. The DPP III cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of many oligopeptides and contributes to the intracellular protein metabolism as well as to endogenous defense against oxidative stress. Human DPP III (h.DPP III) is also related to pathological processes of cataractogenesis, tumor growth and influenza virus infection. The project research should elucidate whether the large flexibility determined for h.DPP III is conserved within DPP IIIs, and how it correlates with the protein function. It would reveal submolecular details important for substrate stabilization and, in the case of h.DPP III, the enzymatic mechanism. Elucidation of the key interactions between h.DPP III and Keap1 protein (Nrf2-Keap1 signalling pathway is major regulator of cytoprotective responses to oxidative and electrophilic stress), and possible correlation of DPP III flexibility with the complex stability, should aid in clarification of its cellular roles. Plant DPP III, differently from DPP IIIs in other organisms possesses a NUDIX box. The project should elucidate its potential dual activity (peptidase and NUDIX). Study of DPP III from thermophile should improve our knowledge on thermophile proteins, potentially useful in biotechnology. In order to fulfill the outlined goals a finely tuned multidisciplinary approach would be used in which molecular biology, biochemistry and mass spectrometry methods would be complemented with bioinformatics, multiscale molecular modeling (coarse grained/all atom MD, QM/MM) and macromolecular crystallography. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|dipeptidyl peptidase III, metallopeptidase, catalytic activity, protein flexibility, MD simulations, QM/MM, H/D exchange, protein interactions|

The stochastic nature of electricity production from RES imposes new challenges for the EPS operation and control. A large share of undispatchable RES can lead to significant disturbances of EPS components. These disturbances need to be balanced out and the security of the system has to be preserved. If the resources for providing balancing energy and flexibility are limited, secure operation of the EPS will become highly expensive. Conventional generation units provide the necessary flexibility to maintain a continuous balance between supply and demand. The question is: are these conventional resources the most feasible way of providing system flexibility in the future low carbon systems? During the recent years, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have become an attractive way of transportation. While passive approach to their integration might cause problems to the system, active utilization of their flexibility might enable higher penetration of RES. A similar reasoning can be applied to the distributed generation, especially technologies with the potential of multi energy vector interaction (efficient electric heating, combined heat and power, battery storage etc.). Current grids need to be capable of dealing with mentioned requirements. The concept of Smart Grid (SG) is based on using of novel information and communication technology (ICT) and includes application of a spectrum of innovative and flexible technologies. The purpose of this project is to establish a methodological and comprehensive framework providing the costs and benefits evaluation of SG projects and technologies. Given the sizeable investments needed, there is a need for a fair, consistent and methodological approach for estimation of the best investment option, taking into account economic and environmental aspects of a specific project. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|energy/power nodes, smart grids, reneawable energy sources, distributed generation, energy storage, plug in electrical vehicles|

At the same time, the addition of the masonry wall to the frame tends to increase the base-shear response and reduce the drift capacity of the structure. The increase of lateral force and reduction of drift capacity leads to serious vulnerabilities unless proper proportioning is exercised. For frames with competent walls, the challenge for safe and economical design is to be able to take advantage of the stiffening but to make certain that the increase in lateral forces and reduction in drift capacity do not handicap performance. Available evidence has pointed out that shear strength of the confining column is the ''Achiless's heel'' of the system. Solution of the problem requires understanding the behavior of masonry and concrete subjected to dynamic and random loading reversals, a challenge that demands testing under reasonably realistic conditions for confident analysis of the problem and its generalization. This is a proposal to investigate the safety and behavior of buildings with masonry-infilled r-c frames through near full-scale dynamic earthquake-simulation tests accompanied by supporting pseudo-dynamic tests of structural assemblies and components and by calibrated analytical solutions. The overall goal is to develop pragmatic methods, by cooperative efforts of team members and co-working international body, for design, safety evaluation and standardization. Because framed-masonry serve both architectural and structural demands efficiently, people in seismic regions live and will continue to live in buildings of this type. An organized solution of the safety of such construction is essential. This proposal intends to put the ''framed-masonry'' composite up as a full-fledged building type, it is ''transformative'' and will change design practice. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|r/c frames, masonry infill, behavior, safety, modelling, standardization, framed-masonry|

FRAMNAT will involve a dynamic team of young scholars and develop innovative methodologies for cultural memory research and cognitive linguistics analysis relevant for Croatia’s academic and policy-making community, as well as a much broader transnational audience. Croatia’s commemorative culture regarding the wars of the 20th century serves as a platform for politicians to operate within the nation-building narratives. Our project will analyze both top-down and bottom-up strategies of framing the nation and collective identities through commemorative practices of World War Two and the Homeland War in Croatia. These discourses will be analyzed at three levels: top-down political discourse (elites), media representation and transmission, and the reception of the narratives in Croatian society (bottom-up reactions). Seven commemorations related to World War 2 and the Homeland War will be observed and analyzed using corpus-based linguistic analysis and frame analysis. The media representations of the commemorative events and opinion poll data will likewise be analyzed in order to map how these discourses are transmitted and received in Croatian society. The project results will be disseminated via a regularly updated website (which includes a database of the collected research materials), journal articles, an edited volume, and papers presented at international conferences. Students and other members of the scholarly community will be encouraged to participate in the project through a variety of workshops to be held at the University of Rijeka. The long-term goal is to develop a Cultural Memory Research Center with scientific methods which can be applied to other regional and international case studies. 					 				|	|History|	|Cultural memory, war, discourse analysis, collective identity, media|

The more specific goal of our project is to produce original contributions in some central areas of research into free will, in the following disciplines: metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics, history of philosophy, philosophy of physics, as well in philosophical interpretations of relevant results of psychology and neuroscience. The most specific goals of the research are the following. First, we plan to show that deterministic threats to free will are surmountable. Second, we plan to show that indeterministic threats (i.e. those based on randomness and luck) are also surmountable. Third, we will argue that some problems with compatibilistic accounts are more serious than has hitherto been recognized. This is due, first, to the fact that, in our opinion, compatibilism is also susceptible to a specific luck objection, and second, to the fact that it is sometimes based on insufficiently clear notions of causality, determinism and natural laws. Fourth, we will argue that Aristotelian version of compatibilism can bring some fresh light to contemporary discussions, but that it is also susceptible to a specific luck objection. Research activities can be grouped under five main headings: 1. Causality, laws of nature and luck (1.1. Causality, laws of nature and action; 1.2. Indeterminism and luck; 1.3. The varieties of determinism), 2. Brain, mind and agency (2.1. Freedom and consciousness, 2.2. Mental causation and ascriptions of intentionality, 2.3. Some perspectives from neuroscience), 3. Moral responsibility (3.1. Principle of Alternative Possibilities, 3.2. Bioenhancement and responsibility), 4. Aristotelian perspective (4.1. Aristotle’s compatibilism, 4.2. Aristotle on moral responsibility and luck), 5.

Branko Ostajmer|	|School system as an educational subsystem of society touches upon and intertwines with political, economic, scientific, cultural, religious and family subsystems of society. In order to be able to understand societal development it is therefore necessary to understand school legislation and educational institutions which, through secondary socialisation, reproduced the desirable normative frameworks for the society within which they operated. Proto-modernisation and modernisation processes implemented during the 18th and 19th centuries were of key importance for forming the school system as an educational system that became an important factor in the emergence of modern civil societies. A research into the problem area of the school system requires a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that differs essentially from the researches undertaken thus far and closed within the boundaries of the discipline. The objectives of this project proposal are to determine, using modern methodological approaches and critically analyzing archival material, factors that were of crucial importance in the process of creation and functioning of Croatia’s school system and for the influence this system exerted, to evaluate correlation of Croatia’s school system with the school system in the Habsburg Monarchy and its reflection on the network of power in the society in the period of (proto)modernisation. The project will result in three volumes of documents that were of crucial importance for the development of Croatia's school system, internet database on students studying at higher schools in the Monarchy, interactive map of educational institutions, a workshop for doctoral students, international scientific conference and an exhibition in the Croatian School Museum. One of the objectives of the project is to create prerequisites for expanding international cooperation and including various topics of history of Croatia's education in internationally funded projects. 					 				|	|History|	|History of Education, Intellectual Transfer, Secularisation, Modernisation, State Education Policy, Habsburg Monarchy|

The OLA project involved research material derived from a special survey carried out in 853 settlements, the result of which was an extremely rich dialectological registry. The material collected does not confirm the traditional view of the disintegration of the Proto-Slavic language, instead showing that the disintegration process of the Slavic whole was much more complex. This is seen in isoglosses that cut Slavic territory into the most highly differing directions. This is proof that particular Slavic groups in various historical periods found themselves in complex relationships amongst themselves and that were constantly changing for economic, political, or cultural reasons. Linguistic material for ALE was collected using a special survey carried out in a majority of European countries, including 15 Croatian survey points. The project also involves the etymological and onomasiological interpretation of linguistic material from all European survey points. This project of linguistic atlases provides world dialectology with organised data on the phonetic, phonological, morphological and lexical systems of a large number of languages and dialects, and enables the well-founded study of the linguistic development of European languages. Croatian material is presented and interpreted, and the linguistic relationships between data from the dialects researched is confirmed. Conclusions are drawn on the history and development of languages, on the relationships between them, and thus on the relationships of the Croatian language towards neighbouring and distant dialects. This will provide material for comparative genetic and typological research of linguistic systems in the Slavic and non-Slavic world. These synchronic and diachronic relationships will be presented in the OLA and ALE books and atlases in the form of maps and commentary. 					 				|	|Philology|	|dialectology, linguistic atlas, linguistic maps, slavic languages, european languages|

However, the increased mineral content in the diet does not guarantee increased mineral status for consumers and consequently mineral malnutrition is one of the global health concerns. Phytic acid (PA) acts as antinutritive compound by binding mineral cations and forming mixed salts. PA is also the main storage molecule for phosphorus and it is essential for normal seed development and germination. Seed mineral and PA content varies widely among bean genotypes. In Croatia bean is traditionally grown in low input production systems. The production is based on landraces which are adapted to local environments and display high levels of morphological diversity. A broad variability is also expected in seed bioactive nutrient content as well as on genetic level. Through international collaboration on Phaseolus genomics, a lot of information has become available including genetic linkage maps, microsatellite databases and a massive number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sequences. In proposed project an integrated approach will be used to characterize bioactive nutrient variability and the inherent genetic diversity. In conjunction with a detailed data on bioactive nutrient content, a whole genome association mapping analysis will be carried out in order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to bioactive nutrient content. Success in bean breeding for higher quality relies on the availability of information on bioactive nutrient content and the knowledge of genetic bases of quality trait variability. The integration of fundamental (molecular genetics) and applied (plant nutrition, plant breeding) sciences will facilitate the management of traditional landraces as sources of bioactive nutrients in future breeding programs based on marker-assisted selection (MAS). 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|Phaseolus vulgaris L., nutrients, bioactive substances, molecular markers, genetic diversity, association mapping|

The synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD), are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of a-synuclein (aSyn). Studies on the rare inherited forms of PD caused by mutations in the aSyn gene have highlighted disturbed aSyn clearance through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) as a key mechanism leading to PD/LBD. Furthermore, several rare inherited disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal genes show parkinsonian-like phenotype and accumulation of aSyn, providing additional evidence for the role of lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. The goal of the project is to elucidate the involvement of lysosomal gene mutations and lysosomal dysfunction in the ethiology of PD/LBD. Using the next-generation sequencing and Haloplex-based protocol we will design LYSOGENE platform to anayze genetic mutations/variations in the ALP genes that may lead to and predispose to PD/LBD. The identified ALP mutations will be further characterized in vitro in human neuronal cell lines using the knockdown and overexpression approaches. In particular, we will monitor how the identified mutations affect ALP function, accumulation and aggregation of aSyn, as well as neurotoxicity. Finally, we will validate our mechanistic findings in a biologically relevant model of human dopaminergic neurons derived from the PD/LBD patient’s fibroblasts using the induced pluripotent stem cell technology. Through these studies we will identify genetic variations/mutations in the ALP genes that cause or contribute to PD/LBD. The results of the project may help to identify potential new therapeutic targets for development of neuroprotective treatments. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Parkinson's Disease, alpha synuclein, next-generation sequencing, lysosomal dysfunction, iPSC|

Maize as a major crop worldwide is essential for industry and is cultivated mostly in rain-fed cropping systems where changes in climate or diminishing water supply take place. Grain yield, the most important trait in maize as a composite trait is influenced by many stress-related traits. The main goal of this project is to elucidate and integrate common genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying the multiple-stress tolerance in maize. The specific aims are to detect genetic and physiological factors responsible for plant response to high plant density, drought, Diabrotica and Fusarium attacks as well as cadmium excess in soil in testcrosses of two maize populations (reference IBM population and a doubled haploid population) and their respective parents. By investigating root and leaf characteristics including chlorophyll fluorescence and other stress parameters as reliable indicators of stress in four-year field and pot experiments conducted in Croatia and Turkey, DNA marker-assisted selection and genomic selection could accelerate maize breeding for yield, abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. A multidisciplinary approach, which ties together breeding, physiology and molecular genetics, can bring a synergistic understanding to the response of maize to multiple stresses. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|drought, diabrotica, plant density, cadmium excess, genomic selection|

The most frequent form of AITD is Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) that is characterised by progressive destruction of thyroid tissue. Many studies tried to unravel genetic contribution to HT development in the past few decades but with low success. The breakthrough of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) tremendously increased the rate of detecting novel associations. However, HT has been unrepresented in the GWAS mostly because of the lack of large cohorts of HT patients and the performance of such study is a matter of urgency. We plan to recruit 500 HT patients and to create a DNA/serum/plasma biobank of deeply phenotyped HT patients that will serve as a powerful resource for current and future investigations. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants underlying HT by performing the first GWAS focusing on HT exclusively. We will use newly recruited HT patients and 500 existing controls (from the “10,000 Dalmatians” study) in case-control GWAS and validate observed associations in an independent replication cohort. To further help in elucidating genetic contribution to HT we will perform pathway analysis and gene-interaction analysis using variety of environmental factors and medical records that will be collected from HT patients. We will also perform deep phenotype characterisation of HT patients that may provide additional clues about HT aetiology. This is timely planned study that aims to generate new knowledge that will advance our understanding of the genetic basis and underlying biological mechanisms of HT. This knowledge will be crucial in guiding the development of new prevention, diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Other benefits of this project include promotion of collaboration, transfer of knowledge, building of infrastructure and it will help in establishment of independent research carrier of principal investigator. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Hashimoto thyroiditis, thyroid gland, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS), statistical genetics, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), biobank|

Mladen Jergović|	|The family Paramyxoviridae harbors a broad spectrum of serious virus pathogens that are of importance to human health and global economics. Paramyxoviruses are RNA viruses with a single-stranded negative sense genome. They have been isolated from a wide variety of species, demonstrating a vast host range and great viral genetic diversity. These ubiquitous pathogens are among the most common causatives of respiratory tract infections and are responsible for a high degree of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The biology of RNA viruses is influenced by their high potential of continuous evolution. Because of the error-prone nature of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and large population sizes, RNA viruses show high levels of genetic diversity. Mutations can significantly influence virus biological properties and lead to appearance of new strains. The knowledge of viral evolution depends on the amount of genomic data available for analysis. We propose the research of viral genomics of wild type paramyxoviruses currently circulating in Croatia. It is our goal to increase the number of genetically well characterized paramyxoviral wild-type strains. The proposed work will add to knowledge about paramyxoviral ecology, variability and evolutionary capacities. As molecular epidemiologic monitoring of circulating wild type viruses enables analysis of current relations between existing viral genotypes, it is an invaluable part of virus surveillance and control, facilitating the detection of endemic areas, estimations of vaccine efficacies and predications of possible outbreaks. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Paramyxoviruses, molecular evolution, genomics, virus genotype, molecular epidemiology|

Nevertheless this phenomenon might be very important and help explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe: our Universe consists of matter, with the negligible amount of antimatter. Despite many attempts a satisfactory explanation for this asymmetry is not yet at hand, although it is generally accepted that the processes responsible for it must violate CP. The qualifying aim of this project is to explore the idea that CP violation may be traced back to gravity. However we believe it is more effective to cope with this problem in the framework of a more general research on parity violating effects in gravity, which we will study by means of modern methods of exploring the gravitational interaction: holography, Kerr black hole horizon-conformal field theory (Kerr-CFT) correspondence, trace anomalies, entanglement entropy, fluid-gravity correspondence. The focus will be in particular on the natural candidates for parity violating gravity processes - the Chern-Simons terms, both pure gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational ones - using extra-dimension models inspired by the string theory. The expected outcome is a significant increase in understanding the consequences of parity violating gravitational interactions, not only in relation with possible CP violations, but also for other effects, e.g. for corrections to black hole entropy. 					 				|	|Physics|	|gravity, black holes, parity violation, quantum anomalies, holography, string theory, conformal symmetry, entanglement entropy|

Reliable ship speed loss estimation under real environmental conditions allows a more accurate prediction of the power increase and fuel consumption as well as gas emissions from ships. Nowadays this second issue becomes very important because of the problem of global warming. Following the increasing awareness of the environmental and human health concerns of shipping, legislative actions have been taken on global and national levels making mandatory (from January 1st 2013) that new ships over 400 gross tonnage, to comply with the regulations, should have emissions of CO2 under limiting value. Technological enhancement to ships like improved hull designs as well as improvement in power and propulsion systems could potentially reduce CO2 emission up to 35 %. These measures could effectively be combined with several other operational measures, such as weather routing and voyage planning, in order to ensure that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from ships are minimized on every voyage. The proposed research will be conducted in three main areas: 1. Improvement of the methodology of ship speed, fuel consumption and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (especially CO2) calculation on actual weather conditions, 2. Optimization of the ship hull (bow and stern) and ship propulsion system operating in actual weather condition, 3. Optimization of ship route by taking into account all relevant parameters: weather prediction, attainable ship speed on waves, main engine performance and navigation constrains. The objective is to improve ship design and performance taking into accounts the environmental issue, creating a so called eco-efficient or “green” ship design. The project team consists of the scientists who are experts in the naval architecture, mechanical engineering and marine engineering field which allow solving this problem multidisciplinary. 					 				|	|Naval architecture|	|seakeeping, ship speed, ship resistance, ship propulsion, fuel consumption, GHG emission, weather routing|

They consist of extremely complex structure defining by triple phases: slow porous medium, mostly laminar fractures and usually fast turbulent conduits/karst channels. Usually, karst aquifers have been analyzed by lumped hydrological models which ignore high heterogeneity of karst and consider only input (precipitation) and output (spring discharge) due to lack of extensive other input data and knowledge regarding the karst system. Last two decades full hydraulic (distributive) models have been developed exclusively by conventional finite elements considering karst heterogeneity structure that improves our understanding of complex processes in karst. Therefore, in this project we will develop novel “unique” flow model based on multi-resolution approach originally designed by Gotovac et al. (2007-2013) for 1-D and 2-D groundwater flow and transport simulations. Proposed approach is based on Fup basis functions with compact support and meshless collocation procedure enabling multi-scale representation of heterogeneity and other flow variables, closely related to the karst flow physical interpretation. Moreover, extending existing procedure to 3-D and constructing separate multi-scale solution for all three karst phases, proposed approach will enable the following impacts in comparison to conventional methods: desired spatial and temporal accuracy and high computational efficiency, modular model structure, incorporation of different heterogeneity scales related to existing measurements, enabling of transport and tracer test analysis and better understanding of karst aquifers due to solving of different engineering problems such as water usage and protection or contaminant pollution. Flow model will be verified by laboratory experiments and numerical synthetic benchmarks as well as real examples such as Jadro catchment and Ombla underground accumulation. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|karst aquifers, groundwater flow modeling, multiresolution and multiscale approach, karst heterogeneity, distributive karst models|

Examples of cultural/architectural and landscape heritage in Croatia are numerous, valuable and diverse. Part of this heritage is recognised worldwide and is protected by UNESCO. Croatia’s most valuable heritage is protected at a national level, although a part of it has, as yet, not been recognised. For various reasons the numerous examples of Croatian heritage are in a poor condition and decaying because they don’t have a permanent use and are not included in the life of cities and towns, despite being formally protected. In former research project, Urban and Landscape Heritage of Croatia as Part of European Culture, cultural heritage was researched in an attempt to present its values and traits as part of Croatia’s national identity and culture. The new project proposal partly supplements previous project thematically and uses results of this research, but the focus of research is on the creative, sustainable and responsible usage of urban, architectural and landscape heritage, which is a non-renewable resource. Contemporary attitudes of conservationists on the holistic protection based on international conservation documents connect protection with urban and regional planning through the concept of sustainable development. The aim of proposed research is to affirm heritage as an active space and spatial resource, to include it in future life and to allow it to be the initiator and active participant in sustainable spatial, social and cultural, economic and touristic development. The research will be based on the selected case studies for each type of cultural heritage. The aim is to define spatial criteria, methods and models for revitalisation and for the implementation of new projects within cultural heritage which may contribute to their enhancement. The project results (criteria, methods, models) will be applied in spatial and urban planning and conservation practices, and will be of far-reaching impact. 					 				|	|Architecture and Urban Environment|	|Cultural Heritage, Urban Planning, Spatial Planning, Heritage Enhancement, Heritage Revival|

The project addresses an interdisciplinary research and combines fundamental and applied research activities in chemical, electrical and environmental engineering fields. The highest possible scientific and technological impact of the project is supposed to be ensured by joining of the human and experimental resources of several different Croatian’s groups. The novel, high power-high energy electrochemical supercapacitor device will be based on hybridization of two different types of electrodes (double-layer and pseudo-capacitive) in a respective electrolyte. Various forms of carbon and carbon based binary and ternary composites with transition metal oxides and/or conducting polymers will be tested as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. For being competitive in the area of energy storage, the tested electrodes should fulfil the requirements of high specific capacitance, long cycle-life, good charge/discharge efficiency, low self discharge and adequate operating voltage. The project is planned to be realized mostly on the basis of fundamental experimental research directed towards increasing of the basic knowledge comprising choice of material, proper design of electrodes and careful elucidation of all underlying physical and chemical processes at active electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The results of fundamental experimental research will be utilized for selection of proper electrodes, their arrangement into electrochemical supercapacitor device, optimization of device to the energy content and power ability, testing of device in practical environment and implementation of device into hybrid electrical vehicle. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|Supercapacitors, electrochemical energy sources, electric vehicles, renewable energy, carbon electrodes, conducting polymers|

The ultimate goal of the proposed experiments, together with other experimental and theoretical investigations, is to provide crucial pieces of information for the understanding how hadrons emerge from their fundamental constituents - the quarks and gluons, why the colour is confined, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the nucleon is much heavier than its constituents. The main objectives in electron scattering experiments at MAMI are: cross section determination of the p(e,e’ ?+)n reaction at Q2=0.078 (GeV/c)2, the lowest measured value till now, of crucial relevance for axial nucleon form factor determination, measurements of virtual Compton scattering in the momentum transfer range of relevance for nucleon structure determination, investigations of 12C(e,epp)10Be and simultaneous measurement of 12C(e,epp)10Be and 12C(e,e’pn)10B reactions of relevance for determination of the role of quark degrees of freedom in nuclei and also for understanding of cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars. The main objectives in the kaonic atoms experiments at LNF are: upgrade of SIDDHARTA setup in order to reach desired resolution and subsequently high precision measurements of transitions in kaonic deuterium, 3He and 4He, that should yield isospin dependent kaon-nucleon scattering lengths. Their precise determination will put strong constraints on the low-energy kaon-nucleon dynamics and eventually constrain the SU(3) description of chiral symmetry breaking. Important component of the project proposal is also development of new detector systems, in particular silicon detector system and diamond detector system with data acquisition based on fast digitizers. 					 				|	|Physics|	|electron scattering, nucleon structure, NN correlations, kaonic atoms, low energy QCD|

Research in this project will be grouped in three major activities, which are: (i) Horizontal Current Bipolar Transistor (HCBT) for RF Wireless Circuits, (ii) Characterization and applications of solid-state photodetectors, and (iii) Modelling of MOS, photodetector and other advanced electron devices. The novel wireless RF communication circuits such as mixer, frequency divider, voltage-controlled oscillator, RF switch and power amplifier will be designed and fabricated in HCBT technology as the first such circuits using the HCBT as an active component. The measurements of noise, reliability and on-wafer uniformity as well as linearity, gain and efficiency will be performed on transistors and circuits. The characterization of material properties of pure amorphous boron (PureB) layers will be made in order to determine the composition, electrical and optical properties of the layer and to develop the model of charge carrier transport through it. They will be correlated with electrical measurements to find out currently-unknown physical mechanisms responsible for the current reduction and for the record-high performance of photodides with PureB layers. The investigation of the novel materials such as Ge, SiGe and GaN for ultra-scaled advanced CMOS structures, i.e. FinFETs, will be performed by the development of novel models and simulation environment. The analog/RF parameters and characteristics will be extracted for FinFETs with different geometries and materials in order to determine the optimum structure for future RF systems. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|semicoductors, microelectronics, bipolar transistors, photodetectors, photodiodes, CMOS, modeling, MOSFET, RF circuits|

The medial (limbic) cortical regions (areas involved in emotion and memory functions) develop a different laminar structure in comparison with lateral cortical regions. Unlike the lateral cortex, where the SP is a major site of neurogenetic events, in the medial archicortex marginal zone (MZ) seems to be a key zone for early molecular neuronal interactions, synaptogenesis and patterning of growing pathways. The goal of this project is to correlate developmental reorganization of major cellular (cell bodies, growing axons) components of the SP and the MZ in developing medial wall of the human cerebrum (cingulum, hippocampus, amygdala) by combining immunochistochemistry, in situ hybridization, transcriptome analysis with in vivo/in vitro MRI. Histological analysis wiil be performed on postmortem human brains, ranging from 10 postconceptional weeks (POW) to 6.5 years, to analyze the expression patterns of different developmentally regulated proteins in relation to synaptic, laminar, neuronal, glial and ECM development. These results will be correlated with in vivo/in vitro MRI findings obtained in age-matched fetuses, infants and children. In addition, we will also analyze publicly available gene expression database (Kang et al., 2011) to investigate the relationship between structural changes and spatio-temporal expression of specific candidate genes. For the selected candidate genes we will perform in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry in order to elucidate in which cells are these genes expressed. The obtained data will be used for setting the baseline for studying developmental abnormalities characteristic for diverse neurological disorders 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|subplate, marginal zone, human brain development, immunohistochemistry, gene expression, in situ hybridization, MRI analysis, hippocampus, cingulum|

It will explore how in the multilingual imperial space of intensive cultural exchange and economic mobility the interethnic and social tensions were shaped by (trans)-intercultural communication and practices, both from above and from below. It focuses on accounts of plural belongings and hybrid identities that are geographically grounded, socio-economically situated and embedded in cultural and linguistic practices manifested by multilingualism and intercultural competence of social scripts and behaviour. The project will cover spatially and regionally confined patterns of interaction in the Croatian part of Istria, and the cities of Pula and Zadar under direct Habsburg influence and in the cities of Rijeka and Zagreb, politically bound to the Hungarian part of the Empire during the period 1870-1918. The main strains of research will focus on uncovering discourses produced through three social spaces, those of institutions (administration and education), associations (cultural, sport), and those visible in everyday life, through consumption practices and tourism. The analyses will encompass social practices in different domains of life, symbolic system (focusing on language) and the use of artifacts, or material life. The specific objective is to provide a contrastive reading of Austro-German, Italian and Slavic sources illuminating both the established discourses of knowledge production, emanating from imperial centres of Vienna and Budapest, and the counter-discourses, and their reception by common people in the periphery. 					 				|	|Ethnology and anthropology|	|multilingualism, transnational, intercultural, communication, hybridity, legacy|

Through its research objectives, the project will investigate networking aspects of human-centric communication, such as the allocation and optimization of cloud and network resources and also providing related quality of service guarantees. This research will be used as a building block for various smart services, which enable user and device adaptation based on learning from previous situations and communicating the results of these situations. This powerful concept relies on new methods in cloud computing for big data processing and Internet-connected objects, such as smart sensors and actuators, as well machine-to-machine communication between devices using self-organizing ad-hoc networks. Smart services are further built upon innovative complex-service composition methodology and intelligent mechanisms to be formulated by the project. The introduction of smart services will drive the changes in the way people interact with devices towards more intuitive and unconstrained means. In particular, contactless user interaction, considering various categories of users, and networked virtual worlds/environments will be studied. Network data traffic models and network management will be proposed, including online charging mechanisms for dynamic pricing and cost calculation of smart services. The research proposed in this project will create new knowledge, strengthen research mentoring and improve young scientist capacities in Croatia, contribute results to science in the area of Information and Communication Technology, and help develop Croatian scientific and research space as one of the long-term strategic priorities, enabling knowledge transfer to Croatian economy for the benefit of society. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|smart network, big data, cloud communications, human computer interface, internet of things|

Thyroid hormones act on every tissue regulating cellular development, differentiation and metabolism. Parathyroid hormones control the amount of calcium in the blood. The expression of thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies is under polygenic control and influenced by environmental factors. The aim of this study is to identify genetic loci that are associated with levels of thyroid/parathyroid hormones and antibodies that will advance our understanding of the genetic basis of their function and thus provide additional knowledge relevant to clinical outcomes. We will perform genome-wide association analysis of thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies on 1,000 individuals from Split region (participants from the 10,001 Dalmatians project). The thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies that are planned to be analysed are: free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, thyroid microsomal antibody titer, thyroglobulin antibody titer and parathiroid hormone. In addition, detailed anamnestic data and phenotype measurements already taken from study participants will be used in realization of second and third project objectives: investigation of relevant gene-environment interactions and determination of phenotype-phenotype correlation. We plan to follow-up interesting findings in additional 2,000 individuals and in datasets sought through international collaboration. Outcomes of such comprehensive approach will be generation of a new knowledge of genetic background, gene-environment interaction and phenotype-phenotype correlation associated with thyroid and parathyroid function that will lead to better understanding of biological pathways and clinically relevant disorders related to their function.

The presence of multiple phases causes a series of limitations, primarily connected to transport phenomena and actually those limitations are the ones that cause their distinct kinetic determination. Due to the complexity and the wide range of heterogeneous processes, research would be limited to solid-liquid systems, taking place in agitated batch reactors. Two heterogeneous processes are to be investigated simultaneously, one that includes and one that excludes a chemical reaction (a. Batch cooling crystallization; b. Ion exchange of heavy metals). The base intention of the proposed project is to find a link between process parameters, hydrodynamic conditions in agitated batch reactor, process kinetics and characteristics of the final product (that is, final process result). Furthermore, the intention is to examine the mentioned relation as a function of reactor scale size as well. Considering the kinetic determination of the process, special attention will be given to the investigation of the influence of hydrodynamic conditions, i.e. the influence of the mixing operation in a batch reactor on the kinetics of the investigated processes. Since one of the goals of this project is to contribute to the theory of reactor design, experimentally obtained insights could represent the criteria basis of heterogeneous solid-liquid process equipment scale up as well as the basis for the mathematical modeling of the impact of operating conditions on the heterogeneous process result. This way the functional relations between studied variables would be established. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|heterogeneous process, batch reactor, process parameters, mixing, kinetics, crystallization, ion exchange, heavy metals, mathematical modeling|

In the focus of this project are conditional reasoning measures of implicit personality that represent “a model for psychometric, conceptual, and theory based implicit association measurement” (Landy, 2008, p. 390). This measurement system is called conditional reasoning because it is based on the assumption that an individual’s reasoning is conditional on his/her personality and that these differences in reasoning can be measured with inductive reasoning tasks capturing unconscious cognitive biases that stem from individuals’ personality motives. The project aims to further advance the knowledge about the conditional reasoning method of personality measurement, and the relationship between (implicit) personality and work behavior by exploring implicit aggression and power motive. We plan to (1) test the implicit nature of conditional reasoning tests and the strength of their relationship with other implicit personality measures intended to assess similar constructs; (2) further explore the relationship between the conditional reasoning tests and work behavior by testing mediators and moderators of that relationship; (3) study how different measures of implicit and explicit personality assessing the same construct (i.e., aggressiveness and power motive) interact in explaining work behaviors. We plan to focus on aggressiveness and power motive because they have the pivotal role in explaining very important aspects of work behavior such as counterproductive work behavior and leadership. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|implicit personality, work behavior, conditional reasoning, aggressiveness, power motive.|

The general purpose of this project is to contribute to the systematic development of the theory of inequalities and to its integration in the current trends in mathematics, especially in the fields of real, functional and numerical analysis. Our aim is also to create and maintain a competent team of researchers whose relevant results and cooperation with other field experts from all over the world will contribute to the promotion of Croatian mathematics worldwide. Specific objectives are: -to improve, refine, interpolate, generalize Jensen’s type inequalities and related inequalities such as Jensen-Steffensen, Hermite-Hadamard, Jensen-Mercer etc. -to prove some generalizations, improvements and refinements of some classical inequalities (Holder, Minkowski, Hilbert, Hardy, Ostrowski, Gruss, Opial, Chebyshev etc.) in various settings -better understanding of different kinds of convexities (higher convexities, s-convexity and h-convexity, exponential convexity, local convexities, Schur-convexity, superquadracity etc.) with applications in inequalities; -to give further extensions and applications of the Mond-Pečarić method in operator theory, especially in obtaining reverse type operator inequalities; -to develop methods and applications of asymptotic expansions and series of special functions (asymptotic expansion and comparison of bivariate and multivariate means; research in series of Bessel and Bessel-like functions, integral expressions and summation formulae for Neumann and Kapteyn series, establishing sharp truncation error estimates occuring in sampling series approximations etc.). We expect to publish more than one hundred papers in this project period. One of our aims is to give overviews of the obtained research results. We plan to publish at least five monographs on these topics. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|inequalities, convexity, operators, asymptotic expansions, series of special functions|

HCV productively infects hepatocytes to impart liver inflammation and progressive tissue damage leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. These processes underlie liver dysfunction and are thought to drive the onset of liver cancer. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which HCV confers hepatic inflammation are not defined. Now, there is growing evidence that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and Kupffer cells (KC), may play key roles in regulating immune responses and facilitating tolerance induction. These cells are playing a pivotal role in blood-borne virus clearance (&gt;90%), leaving only a small fraction of infectious virus that escapes clearance in a manner peculiar to each individual pathogen. The biology of HCV, specifically regarding non-parenchymal liver cells, has been largely neglected. LSEC account for the 20% and KC for 15% of the hepatic cells, and are a unique organ-resident cell population with diverse functions, including degradation of bacterial by-products, antigen presentation and induction of tolerance. The hypothesis of the research is that HCV infection reprograms cellular gene expression of LSEC and KC, which results in the modulation of the inflammatory responses. Applying the infectomics approach, we plan to perform a series of next-generation sequencing experiments on LSEC and KC isolated and purified from healthy, mild and severe chronic hepatitis C liver biopsies. This will allow us to detect expression changes related with disease progression. Selected candidate genes will be comprehensively studied in in vitro systems in order to elucidate their role in modulation of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. Through the development of this project it is expected that a series of high impact results will be obtained, which will facilitate the development of more significant biomarkers and effective interventions against HCV infection. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|HCV, gene expression, Kupffer cells, LSEC, inflammation, immunotolerance|

A broad spectrum of HFRS clinical conditions has been recognized, ranging from inapparent or mild to a fulminant hemorrhagic process with severe renal failure and death. The strong proinflammatory response during acute infection in humans is probably responsible for viral clearance but also for potentially fatal proinflammatory-mediated disease. Innate immunity is the first line of defense to various pathogens which may substantially determine the further development and outcome of disease. There is strong lack of knowledge on innate immune response to HTV in acute phase of disease and no evidence on immune response to reinfection with HTV at all. Overall objective of this project is to identify some key elements of innate immune response in acute HFRS infection and in experimentally simulated HTV reinfection at the level of monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, their crosstalk, “memory” and potential mediation by microRNAs (miRNAs). For that purpose, ex vivo experiments on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes/macrophages and NK cells will be performed in patients with acute HFRS and patients previously encountered HFRS. Primary monocytes/macrophages and NK cells will be additionally infected with HTV and co-cultivated. In order to asses potential miRNAs role, some inhibition experiments will be performed. Computational analysis will follow all experimental process in order to generate new data, pursue study in right direction and indicate important signaling pathways for the future research. Such concept may represent the next step in the design of future vaccines for HTV. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|hantavirses, Puumala, Dobrava, reoinfection, acute infection, monovytes, macrophages, NK cells, innate immunity, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome|

Our research is an extension of the present green campus multidisciplinary research and development. It belongs in the architecture domain, but it also includes interdisciplinary participation from other professions. We refer to the university campus Borongaj in Zagreb as an explicit framework of our research. The plan is to build it as a green campus with the highest level of energy efficiency. In its full form, that campus should be a place for studying, working, learning and living for about 20,000 academic citizens. For that reason, it was necessary to design a complex system and implement cutting-edge green technology and energy efficiency principles: bioclimatic principles of renewable energy sources, advanced technology, smart systems, and user adoptation of the new environment and technology within the methodology of the living laboratory concept. In the proposed three year project the team would research new materials, building elements and construction methods to define those appropriate for implementation. Using Building Information Management software and sustainable design principles the team will develop alternative building proposals that will be analyzed based on detailed energy, cost/benefit and quality of life simulations. The input from the construction industry is also planned. The third phase of the project is a testing phase in which, through student surveys and direct input from a selected group of students, the team expects to refine the proposals. In the end the research result needs to be evaluated within the high expectations of the green campus concept. 					 				|	|Architecture and Urban Environment|	|Architecture, Campus, Green technology, Sustainable Development, Innovative Design|

This new type of industry is based on Smart Factory model or Smart Enterprise. The main features of Smart Enterprise can be summarized into the following: smart personalized product, product and service provider, and high level of collaboration. Manufacturing is today, as it always has been, a cornerstone of the economy of developed nations. An important advantage of manufacturing is that it calls on the skills of everyone from entry-level factory workers to scientists, engineers, and business professionals. Hence, main focus of this project will be Manufacturing Enterprises. Vision of Innovative Smart Enterprise for next generation manufacturing can be summarized into following features: Lean, Flexible, Agile, Efficient, Responsive, Information Enabled, Predictive, and Safe. All these features result with long term sustainability. The main objective of this project is to develop Croatian model of Innovative Smart Enterprise (HR-ISE model). Hence, a profound research will be performed to describe current state of Croatian manufacturing enterprise. It will be the answer on the question: “Where are we?” Furthermore, a synthesis of analysis of Croatian manufacturing enterprises will be done through development of HR-ISE model. It will be the answer on the question: “Where we want to be?” Finally, a special learning environment will be established: Learning Factory. It will be a place in which transfer of developed HR-ISE model to the economy subjects will be achieved. It will be the answer on the question: “How can we get there?” Results of this project will be of the highest value for “fallen” Croatian industry. The development of HR-ISE model and its transfer to economy can have strong impact on recovery of Croatian industry, and it can significantly improve competencies and capabilities of Croatian enterprises. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|innovation, smart enterprise, learning factory, production systems, business model|

Social Entrepreneurship is one of the leading and growing phenomena, it has outcomes in social, economic and environmental fields, and as such is suitable and studious for scientific research. This is especially the case in a country such as Croatia, with longstanding economic crisis, rise of unemployment; decrease of social rights and trust, but at the same time quite a wealth of natural resources and tradition in cooperative business models. The project has a specific objective to initiate and secure long term scientific base and data for research on social entrepreneurship in Croatia; to set up a relevant and up to date published materials about social entrepreneurship open to science community and public; to test the level of 3BL (Triple bottom line) in social enterprises in Croatia; and to prepare guidelines and “advice book” for potential social entrepreneurs and recommendations for important and interested stakeholders. Through the three years of project duration, an already experienced scientist and researchers with young colleagues will explore and define the concept of social entrepreneurship, compare and elaborate EU perspectives and conditions regarding the subject of the project, but also place considerable emphasis on methodological approach that should provide us with reliable and operable scientific data. The project consists of a balanced and well suited mix of qualitative and quantitative scientific methods depending on applicability and specific needs within the project. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time in Croatia that the scientific community recognised social entrepreneurship as a valuable subject for long-term analytical work and research. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|social entrepreneurship, sustainability, social benefits, responsible, business model|

The pathological remodelling occurring in ischemic myocardium gradually leads to chronic contractile dysfunction and affects many intracellular mechanisms participating in energy production, calcium homeostasis and apoptosis. In the current project, we propose to investigate these pathological processes in patients suffering from the CAD. Patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery will be included and will undergo a detailed cardiac evaluation, which, in addition to standard diagnostic tools, will be enriched by the advanced diagnostic techniques still non-existing in Croatia (stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging). This will provide accurate identification and quantification of regional myocardial ischemia. Following clinical evaluation and during revascularization surgery, left ventricular biopsies will be taken from characterized ischemic regions, as well as from non-ischemic regions, and a detailed analysis of intracellular energy metabolism, calcium-contractility and endoplasmic reticulum stress will be performed. The Specific Aims of the project are: Aim #1 is to assess regional myocardial perfusion and function in patients with CAD who are considered for revascularization therapy. Aim #2 will investigate pathological processes affecting mitochondria, calcium homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum stress that take place in the ischemic parts of myocardium. Aim #3 is to evaluate the effects of the heart rate-lowering pharmacological therapy on ischemic myocardium. Thus, the overreaching aim of this proposal is to investigate intracellular mechanisms underlying myocardial adaptation and remodelling in chronic ischemia and to identify predictors of outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing revascularization therapy. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|myocardial ischemia, chronic heart failure, cardiac bioenergetics, cardiomyocyte pathophysiology, cardiac imaging|

A common denominator for both aspects are the methods used to study them: social interaction can be descibed and simulated using agent-based models (ABM social science perspective) whilst distributed AI is commonly modelled in terms of multi-agent systems (MAS computer science perspective). The important question to ask in both perspectives is how do agents organize in order to perform their tasks and reach their objectives? Herein we will employ a combined empirical and theoretical approach towards finding the answer to this question. From the empirical side, we shall study the human behaviour on a number of venues across various gaming servers in order to find most suitable structures, cultures, processes, strategies and dynamics employed by most successful player communities. From the theoretical side, we shall test a multitude of organizational architectures from organization theory in various MMORPG settings, and compare them with methods found in empirical research. Our research is therefore aimed towards enriching the organizational design methods for the development of MMORPG to foster the development of self-organizing and adaptable networks of large-scale multi-agent systems. With this in mind, our main goals are: 1) To identify and formalize adequate organizational design methods for developing LSMAS in MMORPGs. 2) To couple them with real-life and future scenarios from industry. 3) To provide open and accessible tools, which will allow for design, development, implementation, control, simulation and maintenance of LSMAS in MMORPG. 					 				|	|Information and communication sciences|	|large-scale multi-agent systems, agent based modeling, mmorpg, organizational methods, organizational design, artificial intelligence|

Nikša Krstulović Rok Zaplotnik (dr. sc.)|	|Cold and low-density plasmas are currently in focus of basic research worldwide due to many open questions regarding their complex nature and simultaneously due to their high potential for applications in various fields of research and technology. Plasmas can be produced by bombarding matter either with energetic electrons or with energetic photons. The first kind is related to use of various discharges and the second to use of powerful lasers. Our interest is in plasmas produced in vacuum, under low-pressure gas environment, at atmospheric air or on/within liquids. Discharges which we use range from electrodeless, single electrode to various designs of two electrode systems. Lasers we use are cw or pulsed nanosecond. In our research special care will be devoted to tailoring the electron energy distribution functions as a key factor influencing plasma content and features. This is usually done by changing macroscopic plasma parameters - gas pressure, electrical fields and geometry of discharges. In this project we shall combine laser produced plasmas with discharge plasmas to achieve that goal. To understand the complex nature of plasma or processes of plasma interaction with other matter phases (gases, liquids and solids) basic approach is to perform plasma diagnostics by various types of optical and laser spectroscopies. To interpret findings we study basic atomic collision processes in plasmas and structure and spectra of various complexes formed within plasma (dimers, radicals etc). Modeling of various processes within cold plasmas and laser produced plasmas is performed in addition. In various applications in which plasma treatment of matter is used there is a need for in situ monitoring of processes both in plasma and at interfaces and therefore both spatial and temporal spectral resolution of applied detection techniques are important. We use classical emission and absorption laser spectroscopies and modern techniques such as a cavity ring-down spectroscopy. 					 				|	|Physics|	|low temperature plasmas, laser produced plasmas, cold plasmas, atmospherics plasmas, laser spectroscopy|

It will integrate analyses of burial features and associated artifacts with analyses of cremated human remains from at least seven urnfield cemeteries in northern Croatia, dated between 13th and 9th century BC. We shall seek correlations between skeletal and artifactual evidence, which should allow us to recognize regularities and possible discrepancies linked to a specific gender or age group. Our primary aim is to investigate the variability of mortuary practices as reflected in modes of corpse treatment and disposal. At a more general level, we shall combine our data in order to investigate LBA social identities in southern Carpathian Basin. Our second aim is to investigate whether the traditionally perceived difference between 'Urnfield culture' and 'Belegiš II group' can be detected in mortuary evidence other than urns. Our sample of 120 burials covers a time span of six centuries, which will allow us to monitor the diversity of mortuary practices during the entire LBA and also contribute to the resolution of regional chronology. In order to archive the data, as well as to distribute and promote our findings, we shall design a public-access data base, organize a round table with experts from region and publish our results in a monograph. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Late Bronze Age, mortuary practices, society, archaeology, anthropology, southern Carpathian Basin|

The properties of such systems can be described only by taking into account collective phenomena governed by strong and competing interactions, often leading to frustrations. The subtle interplay of interactions is, in turn, a key ingredient for extraordinary complex phase diagrams exhibited by SCES. Even more interesting are regions of instabilities away from stable phases. The way a new phase emerges close to a phase boundary reveals hidden properties of the studied system. It is extremely important to understand how symmetry breaks in the transition itself and identify the space and time-scales relevant for the changes of order parameter within the transition. Sometimes an intermediate state emerges between two stable phases, bringing new physics to light. This project aims to study some of these new, mostly unexplored states that emerge between well explored stable phases in SCES, or as a consequence of some kind of frustration. In order to obtain a complete picture of new states of matter we will combine several advanced experimental methods: nuclear magnetic and quadrupolar resonance (NMR and NQR) as an atomic-scale, local probe, and nonlinear conductivity as a mesoscopic probe of electronic physics. We will be able to systematically study the many phases and transitions in SCES, provide answers to some currently burning questions, and significantly advance our knowledge about them. In particular, we will study charge order in novel superconductors, and spin liquid and spin nematic states in frustrated quantum spin systems. The project will fully employ the new broadband NMR laboratory in Zagreb, strengthen its visibility and international collaborations, and enable finishing of three PhD theses. 					 				|	|Physics|	|nuclear magnetic resonance, microwaves, cuprates, pnictides, frustrated spin systems, charge order|

The project will attempt to reconstruct the specific karst lake landscapes and their surroundings in view of environmental and climate change and human migration from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through the Holocene. LoLADRIA will provide long, high resolution, paleohydrological reconstructions from a region extremely sensitive to changes in effective moisture and atmospheric dynamics. The multiproxy-based reconstructed curves will provide new data to identify and date the main climate events, and to characterize the climate variability at century and millennium scale since the LGM. Pollen and ostracods offer the possibility to develop transfer functions in order to reconstruct quantitative changes in regional climate and hydrological conditions of the lakes. LoLADRIA will offer an environmental context which enabled the human entrance to Europe along the eastern Adriatic shelf since this pathway is still widely unknown and the detailed framework of climatic and environmental conditions still requires extensive research. In combination with landscape reconstruction based on high resolution geophysical methods will allow the insight to the preserved changes in the landscapes at selected sites along the Eastern Adriatic and their habitability related to the Mesolithic cultures that were present there. Submarine prehistoric sites in the Mediterranean show that the continental shelf was occupied by humans to a depth of at least -40m, and the lost (submarine) lakes and surrounding submerged landscapes of the eastern Adriatic have a potential for site discovery. 					 				|	|Geology|	|Paleolimnology, Paleoclimate, Last Glacial Maximum, Holocene, Pleistocene, Mesolithic, Sea Level Rise, Proxies, Human Migration, Adriatic Shelf, Karst|

This project aims to address the subject by fully exploiting the advantage of embedded paramagnetic centres through focusing on their relaxation behaviour, which bears the information about the local frustration of the environment. The energy exchange within the spin system and between the spin system and the lattice will be detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) as a function of disorder in the vicinity of the paramagnetic centre. This we can control by preparing the host matrix in the glassy, supercooled or crystalline state. We propose to investigate the specific molecular dynamics due to the presence of disorder in the system while switching the very same compound doped with paramagnetic centres from disordered to more ordered state, such as from glassy to crystalline state. Additionally, the microscopic picture of local disordered sites will be examined in other systems doped with paramagnetic centres such as various polymer matrices or hydrogen-bonded crystals. The origin of local disorder will be correlated with the influence of different numbers of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of paramagnetic site as well as with the degree of local spin frustration. We expect that this comparative study will enlighten the peculiarities of vibrational density of states of amorphous materials and contribute towards development of the unique model of low-temperature molecular dynamics of disordered systems in general. 					 				|	|Physics|	|ESR, disorder, boson peak, spin relaxation, spin frustration|

In our work we will concentrate on descriptive induction whose goal is to construct knowledge that enables human understanding of the data. Included are techniques for construction of user-interpretable models, segmentation of the corpus of examples, and detection of outliers. The methodology is relevant for the computer science fields known as intelligent data analysis, knowledge discovery from data, and data mining. At Rudjer Boskovic Institute we are developing machine learning algorithms for more than 15 years and we have successfully applied them in various domains including chemistry, biology, medicine, social sciences, economics, and manufacturing. With this project we want to extend the existing methodology and to implement novel techniques able to cope with data contained in complex structures. The main topic will be spatio-temporal structures but we will work also with networks of data, relational databases, and data contained in ontologies. Previous experience clearly demonstrates that complete transformation of information contained in structured data into a form that may enter the induction process is not a simple task. Our goal is to develop and implement systematic and general approaches for this conversion. The consequence will be explosion of generated data that must enter into the process of induction. Therefore, the second goal will be implementation of efficient algorithms for descriptive induction. The work includes development of novel algorithms for clustering and outlier detection in sets of unclassified examples and implementation of hardware for fast execution of rule learning algorithms. The third goal is application and evaluation of implemented algorithms in various real-life domains. The success of the complete project will be measured by the quality and usefulness of knowledge obtained in these applications. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|machine learning, knowledge discovery, structured data, rule learning, FPGA|

Anita Buhin|	|Making of a “new man” – and woman in the present-day terms – is a concept that has constantly been re-examined and discussed in many political and geographical contexts throughout the twentieth century. The focus of this research project highlights a specific historical situation: the endeavours of Yugoslav authorities in making of a new socialist citizen after the World War II, especially in Croatia as one of the republics forming the Yugoslav Federation. The socialist citizen was first placed in a strongly Soviet-oriented society, but the situation very soon shifted towards a specific kind of Yugoslav self-management and market socialism. The long period of four and a half decades (1945-1990) calls for special attention due to changes in the political system over time: from the formative period of the socialist man to the partial deconstruction of the concept. In many ways Croatia represents an excellent case-study for the research of the Yugoslav society, but in this project it will always be included in the Yugoslav framework and – whenever necessary – in a wider historical context and related comparatively to other socialist societies ruled by communist parties. The academic profile of researchers included in the project guarantees that the new socialist citizen will be closely analyzed in a variety of his or her appearances: from childhood to retirement, in work and leisure or sport, as a creator and a recipient of culture, from the theoretical ideals of high politics to the successful or problematic practices. A wide selection of written, visual and oral sources will be interpreted with a complex multi-disciplinary methodology that includes political, economic, social and cultural history, social and cultural anthropology, cultural studies and linguistics. The aim is to set a new light to the period and topic that are still under-researched by the Croatian and other post-Yugoslav humanities. 					 				|	|History|	|socialist society, self-management, ideology in practice, communist indoctrination, Croatia, Yugoslavia|

By 2020 there will be 8 billion people and 50 billion machines in the world and almost all of them will be connected through some kind of network. Furthermore, people and machines that share a certain collective goal will be grouped into some kind of organization, which again will be connected with other organizations and/or people/machines. In order to maintain sustainability of the networked society we need a framework and algorithms which will enable us to i) manage trust; and ii) coordinate interactions in such a complex eco-system consisting of thousands, millions or even billions of interconnected entities. Both the framework and algorithms should be scalable and robust (from the perspective of a network size and heterogeneity), support real-time dynamics (from the perspective of network interactions) as well as be applicable and analyzable at different levels of granularity (at a micro, mezzo and macro network levels). A possible solution for the framework is the “Smart Network”, where people/machines/organizations are represented as nodes which are described by profiles and build a network of connections. The “smartness” of “Smart Networks” stems from profiling nodes and realizing connections using automated computational methods, what is enabled by latest enhancements in information systems and state-of-the-art solutions in communication technologies. The “Smart Network” framework enables design of scalable, robust and real-time algorithms for managing trust and coordinating interactions because it can be i) formally operationalized as a graph where edges represent nodes and vertices represent connections; ii) functionally modeled as a multi-agent system where agents embody edges and relationships embody vertices; and iii) analyzed through complexity theory where sustainable solutions emerge as a result of a bottom-up modeling principle. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|social networks, machine-to-machine communication, networked organizations, networked society, trust, coordination, context-awareness, big data|

Thin and composite structures are of extreme importance for applications in engineering (e.g. building blocks, boats, ships, aircraft design) and biology (bones, biological tissues, blood vessels) where they are often subjected to fluid load. The analysis of these kind of complex multi-physics systems is very challenging from the mathematical point of view. Namely, the analysis of thin and composite structures and fluids includes the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations (nonlinear PDEs), which leads to interesting mathematical questions (Gamma limits of a certain system of nonlinear equations with highly oscillating coefficients, existence for a certain system of nonlinear PDEs). This project plans the following: derivation of lower dimensional models in elasticity for highly oscillating materials, optimal design problems, derivation and analysis of fluid-structure interaction problems (derivation of coupling conditions, well-posedness and asymptotic stability analysis). We will use both Calculus of Variation and PDEs techniques to approach different topics, using the benefits from both. We strongly believe that this diversity will bring additional value to Croatian applied mathematics and will provide young people to develop and get acquainted with different approaches of the modern applied mathematics. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|thin structures, composite structures, dimensional reduction, homogenization, Gamma convergence, fluid-structure interaction, existence of solution|

Marija Prša|	|We frequently deal with systems described by the differential equations coming from conservation laws that are too complicated to be solved and are of limited use in practice. In many such situations the original physical laws can be replaced by empirical laws or other approximations derived on engineering level of rigor. Mathematical point of view requires justification of those models to see their validity, applicability and accuracy. That can be achieved theoretically by investigating the deviation from the original model, or numerically by comparing simulations with experimental data. Each approach, has its advantages and disadvantages and are, frequently, complementary. In the frame of MaSiMo project we will consider fluid flow through thin domains like pipes and fractures, as well as low permeability domains as porous media.The fluids are either Newtonian or micropolar, monophase or multiphase. Physical processes in those fluids are convective, diffusive, dispersive or conductive, isothermal or nonisothermal. Theoretical analysis is based on a priori estimates for governing differential equations, different notions of convergence and compactness. In particular asymptotic analysis and homogenization will be used. For derivation of a priori estimates a powerful tool is the entropy dissipation method that is considered in this project in the context of nonlinear diffusion and population dynamics problems with a perspective of extension to other considered models. Proposed research is connected to many engineering disciplines, such as mechanical and petroleum engineering, hydrogeology etc. Expected results could improve engineering practice. In Croatian mathematical community there is a significant research in this field with several trained scientists. However, they are dispersed in smaller groups. One of the aims of this project is formation of larger research group with focused scientific interests more competitive in a search for European grants. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Mathematical modelling,Asymptotic analysis,Numerical simulations,Fluid flow,Homogenization, Boundary layer,Lubrication,Complex fluids,Porous medium|

Such operator theoretic models are particularly amenable to be treated algebraically in the context of efficient and robust computational procedures of modern numerical linear algebra. The themes include adaptive (interior penalty) discontinuous Galerkin method in the penalty based formulation of the model for the complex mechanical system (e.g. stent), and vibration analysis for powertrains (car industry). In a related topic of vibration control, we study distributed control using dynamic multipliers from the dissipativity theory. In the frequency domain, we consider the problems of system identification and model order reduction posed as problems of rational approximation in the Hardy space H2. For all considered problems, we devise numerical algorithms and identify core numerical linear algebra computational tasks for which we plan to develop robust algorithms. These include Arnoldi-type eigensolver for both linear and quadratic large scale eigenvalue problems, and high accuracy algorithms for structured matrices of paired Cauchy structure. All developed algorithms will be delivered also as high performance mathematical software. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|scientific computing, complex mechanical systems, eigenvalue problems, model reduction, distributed control, high perfomance scientif computing|

Objective of MIAU project is to contribute to our understanding of this strong force as described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Additionally, we aim to study physical processes happening at hadron accelerators, including electroweak production of as-yet-unseen particles at the large hadron collider (LHC). Thereby, we will investigate models of new physics in which such new particles are introduced in attempts to explain neutrino masses and abundance of dark matter in the universe. To achieve these objectives we will study specific hadronic processes, both in the high-energy regime where strong force is weak enough for perturbative approach, as well as in regimes where non-perturbative features of QCD, such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking come to the fore. Our focus will be on processes measured by the range of experimental collaborations which will facilitate close contact with reality and immediate testing of our results and ideas. As outcome, we expect to be able to significantly improve the knowledge of the quark-gluon structure of the proton, as encoded by the so-called generalized parton distributions, to improve the description of various meson properties in vacuum and at finite densities and temperatures, to elucidate QCD phase diagram in model frameworks, and to set bounds to the parameter space of several models of new physics. 					 				|	|Physics|	|quantum chromodynamics, hadrons, quarks and gluons, quark matter, leptons, neutrino mass, new particles at LHC, dark matter|

Psychology of education attempts to identify mental processes and mechanisms underlying our ability to learn. Research on self-regulated learning and metacognition is a topic of special importance for educational psychology. Self-regulated learning encompasses cognitive, motivational and behavioral processes which occur while learners undertake activities to accomplish a learning goal. Self-regulation is based on a cyclical process of monitoring and control. The learner monitors the efficiency of the applied learning strategies and responds to feedback obtained from the monitoring process. Metacognition is studied intensively in the areas of memory and text comprehension. The central aim of the project is to explore metacognitive processes of monitoring and control in the domains of: 1. Category learning, 2. Thinking, 3. Grounded (situated) comprehension. All of these domains have been studied extensively but in isolation from metacognition. Our goal is to bring together these disparate fields of study under the same research program. Unifying theme of the project is the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 processes which can be identified in each domain and whose properties will guide metacognitive judgments. Project team consists of 5 established researchers in the field of experimental psychology and 5 doctoral students whose PhD theses are closely related to the project aims. The project team will utilize newly established Laboratory for experimental psychology equipped with facilities necessary to carry out the proposed project. The project will answer the important question of how accurate are the metacognitive judgments and how effective are the processes of monitoring and regulation in the cognitive domains where metacognition has not been studied in greater detail. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|metacognition, monitoring, dual processes, category learning, thinking, comprehension|

Ions are very efficient in creating numerous ionizations on their path through the material by ejecting/exciting electrons (electron stopping) and in creating vacancies by recoiling the whole atoms (nuclei) from their lattice sites (nuclear stopping). Therefore, irradiation of materials with energetic ion beams is considered as a) an efficient tool to alter materials physical, chemical, electrical and optical properties and b) a sensitive probe that can be used to characterise materials using some of the Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) methods. Understanding of complicated dynamical processes that lead to structural modifications of materials requires the knowledge of experimental data related to kinematics of defects during and after irradiation. Therefore the goal of the present proposal is experimental study of the time evolution of radiation induced changes induced by energetic (MeV) ion beams and their characterization using the RBI Tandem Accelerator Facility. The focus will be on studying: (i) influence of electronic stopping and related nanostructuring of materials by ion track methodology; (ii) influence of nuclear stopping to radiation damage and amorphization in crystals, including crystalline and functional materials of interest for future fusion reactors; (iii) charge transport properties in crystalline materials, focusing on novel semiconductor materials for radiation detection. Experimental methodology relies mostly on the unique RBI dual-beam end station that will be used for ion beam irradiations and simultaneous characterization of induced changes using IBA methods like RBS and PIXE in channelling mode, ERDA, NRA and PIGE, as well as IBIC (Ion Beam Induced Charge). 					 				|	|Physics|	|MeV Ion Beams, Stopping Power, Ion Beam Modification of Materials, Ion Beam Analysis, Ion Beam Channeling, IBIC, RBS, PIXE, PIGE|

Despite common principles in connectivity, human cerebral cortex contains specific neuron types like associative layer III pyramidal neurons and subtypes of calretinin expressing GABA-interneurons. They are key elements of human microcircuitry which molecular specificity and neuronal interaction between and inside columns needs to be determined in order to assess how human cerebral cortex processes information. The aim of this project is to study organization and molecular properties of microcircuitry in the human frontal cortex that is believed to have unique features being the biological substrate for the most complex cognitive functions. The emphasis is to use histo-molecular techniques to dissect connectivity at cellular level and to establish a experimental monkey model to study microcircuitry in collaboration with Brain Dynamic Institute Marseille (http://ins.medecine.univmed.fr/) and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig (http://www.eva.mpg.de/). This will enable formation of unique database providing structural, physiological, molecular and genetic fingerprint of identified neurons as well as their connectivity within the entire cortical network in primates. Such database will be extremely valuable to create a simulation model of the human brain and to understand neuronal network alterations in various brain disorders. Studying cortical circuitry in the human is in the focus of current neuroscience research. Proposed project has potential to overcome gap in knowledge at cellular level, providing information gainful for more comprehensive interpretation of data obtained by imaging studies.

A practical objective of the proposed research project is to build an optimal economic growth/cycle model for Croatia using Advanced Growth Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm (AGSIFAL) that we plan to build. In order to do so, an algorithm (selected from the best of artificial neural network model, structural econometric model, dynamic general equilibrium model, nonlinear econometric model, golden triangle model) for cycle/growth sequencing and forecasting will be developed. Sequencing of the economic growth on a international scale (119 countries) will be performed using business cycle tracer methods and novel golden triangle model developed by Škare (2010). For this purpose, advanced cycle/growth algorithm will be created. Using individual country data as primer, we plan to isolate growth determinants using three dimensional golden triangle model and spectral analysis techniques. Output, inflation and employment form the three dimension of the cycle/growth triangle that will be used for sequencing growth. After a growth sequencing is finished, a best forecasting algorithm is built from the derived growth sequencing bases. Pairing isolated growth determinants help us to rebuild a growth sequence. Using different algorithm models, reconstructed economic growth series is compared to the actual growth series (observed data). Algorithm resulting in the smallest forecast error (RMSE) is selected as optimal to explain economic growth and predict business cycles. EThis conclusion will have important theoretical and policy implications both for the science of economics and economic agents on the market. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Growth, forecasting, algorithm, dynamic models, golden triangle model|

The context of the socio-technological framework that transcends the organisational innovation dynamics within contemporary engineering systems and services life-cycle requires the research overriding commitment to methodological pluralism.

The research will build on state of the art developments in the exploration of principles of knowledge management for R&amp;D organisations and will go further; in that it will seek to incorporate the insights from modelling, simulation and visualisation of the complex social, natural and technical systems to the knowledge and information dynamics that encompass the generation, storage, dissemination, filtering, and reprocessing of innovation across hierarchical socio-technological networks. The research effort will entail the development of concepts, theories, metrics and case studies related to the R&amp;D organisational innovation management. The controlled experiments in real-world private and public R&amp;D organisations will be used in research to gain valuable insights across different sectors (automotive, aerospace, energy, transportation, healthcare, public administration, etc.).

Project initial hypothesis is that artist networks, art groups and art associations form the most important platform of cultural exchange in modern and contemporary visual arts due to the similarity of underlying organization and communication models regardless of geo-cultural location at which they appear. A degree of their diversity in art practice of particular local community at particular historical moment is proportional to the dynamics and volume of its participation in the international/cross-cultural exchange. To prove our hypothesis and identify, describe and explain these organization and communication models as generally applicable – which is the main objective of the project - we shall investigate Croatian artist networking and collaborative practices on the background of similar phenomena in other European countries and with regard to poetic requirements of different periods in modern and contemporary art, conventions of social interactions and available techniques/technologies of communication. As the methodology of art history does not meet the complexity of the research topic, we shall develop interdisciplinary methodological apparatus combining knowledge and analytic tools of art history, sociology and information science. Considerable amount of data collected through the extensive infield research will be stored in Croatian Artists Networks Information System developed in the course of the project and supporting network visualization techniques as a cognitive research tool for experimental presentation of our research results framed with the appropriate structural narratives (textual, visual, GIS data).

This will be achieved by interdisciplinary research team (composed of veterinarians, biologists and forester) divided in four main topics: parasitology, environmental conditions and GIS modelling, MHC genes polymorphism in wildlife and epidemiology and molecular epidemiology. Other objectives of the project are to facilitate establishment of internationally competent multidisciplinary research team through research, cooperation and continuing professional development and to enhance development of molecular epidemiology in Croatia. With such comprehensive approach proposed project offers for the first time in Croatia creation of multidisciplinary team that will analyse all aspects of wildlife diseases and important environmental factors. Furthermore, molecular epidemiology will provide insights into susceptibility to disease and potential survival rate that is dependent on major histocompatibility complex variations. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|molecular epidemiology, wildlife, parasitology, MHC genes, GIS modelling|

Integrins are cell surface molecules that mediate sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion, and therefore represent a suitable target for therapy. This proposal investigates the molecular mechanism behind knockdown of integrins alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 using integrin subunit specific siRNAs (beta 3, beta 5, beta 6, alpha v, alpha 3, alpha 4 or alpha 5) and the ability of such a treatment to sensitise TNBC and melanoma cell lines to anticancer drugs paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. Our next goal is to identify how specific integrin knockdown influences cell migration and invasion. The focal adhesions (FA) are sites of attachment between cells and extracellular matrix which may mediate differential cell responses by variation of FA protein composition. Therefore, the FA protein composition will be investigated before and upon integrin silencing using proteomics methodology. We will monitor formation and temporal evolution of FA in living cells during spreading or migration using reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM). On the basis of these data, several signalling pathways will be proposed and their involvement in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion will be experimentally verified. Our data will contribute to the knowledge on integrin signalling pathways, structure and function of focal adhesions. The understanding of integrin pathways involved in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion processes may provide novel insights into biology of these cancer cells and identify new target molecules in TNBC or melanoma. 					 				|	|Biology|	|breast cancer, melanoma, signalling pathways, anticancer drug resistance, focal adhesion, migration, invasion|

The evidence has been accumulated indicating the role of PVR and its receptors in immune surveillance including the control of viral infections, tumors, as well as in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Of note is that PVR is constitutively expressed on the majority of somatic cells, while its receptors are expressed on the majority of lymphocyte population. In many respects the interaction of PVR with its paired set of inhibitory and activating receptors resemble the interaction of paired co-stimulatory immune cell receptors and their cellular ligands (B7/CD28/CTLA-4). These co-stimulatory molecules have been the subject of intensive studies that resulted in immunoregulatory pharmaceutical agents for use in humans. The studies proposed here are based on the finding that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) affects the surface expression of PVR (Nat Immunol. 2005) and on our preliminary results indicating that mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) also downregulates mouse PVR. Thus, we first focused on the identification of MCMV gene(s) (proteins) involved in the PVR regulation, but also on the consequence of this viral regulation on antiviral immune response in vivo. To that aim we will generate MCMV mutants lacking viral regulators and test their in vivo susceptibility to components of innate and acquired immune response. We expect that the results obtained will further broaden the knowledge of PVR regulation and its significance in immune control, which will eventually help to translate this knowledge to developing new immunotherapeutic tools. Namely, one aim of this project is to engineer antibody specific for human PVR in order to be used as a tool in targeted tumor therapy. This idea is based on the fact that many tumors over-express PVR, which could be used in antibody mediated uptake of anti-tumor compounds. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|poliovirus receptor, PVR, CD155, cytomegalovirus, CMV, immunoevasion, tumor|

Consequently, opportunities for computer vision applications are becoming more and more abundant. Understanding dynamic traffic scenes is especially interesting due to exciting applications in the fields of smart vehicles (driver assistance, autonomous cars) and intelligent transportation systems (road safety inspection, adaptive traffic control). Nevertheless, many of these applications are out of reach since the computers are still unable to match human perception. We believe that this gap would be reduced by improving our understanding of scalable detection of multiple object classes in dynamic scenes. The task of object detection is to localize objects of interest in input images. We address detection in the most general case where the objects of interest exhibit large appearance variation. In this case the problem is often referred to as multi-class object detection. Our proposal focuses on dynamic traffic scenes acquired by a calibrated stereo rig from the driver's perspective. We propose to develop detection approaches which would combine estimated camera motion and scene structure with learned appearance features, and to experimentally compare them with the state of the art. We shall employ advanced methodologies such as SfM, dense stereo, variational optimization, scene flow, spatio-temporal descriptors, latent SVM and Fisher vectors. These methodologies shall enable us to achieve improvements upon the state of the art in terms of scalability and detection performance. This will open way to exciting applications capable of reducing traffic accidents, improving efficiency and decreasing traffic congestion. Some of these applications shall be demonstrated by experiments on a real autonomous car. The proposed research would also contribute to a future unified theory of computer vision which would encompass detection, reconstruction and categorization. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|Computer vision, structure from motion, object detection, image categorization, multi-body structure from motion|

Small molecules selectively targeting specific DNAs or RNAs are therefore highly interesting not only to understand such processes in more detail but also for potential medicinal applications, as sensors or probes for fluorescence based bioimaging as well as for analytical purposes in isolated biosamples. Proposal is based on the collaboration between I. Piantanida and Prof. Dr. C. Schmuck (Germany), joined results in leading chemistry journals (Chemistry, Eur. J; 2010 and 2012, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; Org. Biomol. Chem. 2011, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008). We want to design, synthesize and study highly selective probes for the sensing of DNA/RNA with emphasis on the multi-purpose probes: single molecules able to simultaneously differentiate by several highly sensitive spectrometric methods between the most common secondary structures of ds- DNA/RNA. For increased affinity and selectivity, we plan to test new, more efficient fluorophores (cyanine, phenanthridine, fluorescent nucleobases-Piantanida group) combined with pyrrole-guanidinium cations (Schmuck group) and explore structural diversity of the compounds, by combinatorial approach (solid phase synthesis) based on peptide backbone carrying recognition units/fluorophores. The interaction with DNA/RNA will be studied by Piantanida group (UV/Vis, fluorescence, CD/LD spectroscopy, DSC/ITC microcalorimetry), screening of oligopeptide libraries by IRORI method and atomic force microscopy by Schmuck group. Proposal addresses CSF goals: a) support the collaboration with well-established international leaders, b) foster training of young researchers by work on the INTERNATIONAL research; c) expected results with commercializing potential (novel biochemical probes and/or drugs).

Diseases that used to be limited only to tropical areas are now increasingly spreading to other previously unaffected regions. A wide variety of pathogens that can be propagated and transmitted by ticks infect humans, wildlife or domestic animals. Over the past decades, the scientific landscape of tick-borne diseases has changed significantly due to advances in molecular biology. Several new rickettsial and ehrlichial diseases, as well as new Borrelia and Babesia genotypes have been confirmed, and consequently, improved diagnostics of emerging diseases in veterinary and human medicine. A number of cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease have increased. To better understand the importance of tick-borne diseases, a proposed project follows an interdisciplinary approach involving physicians, veterinarians and biologists, also known as One Health approach. Since the cultivation of pathogens is difficult and slow, and for number of pathogens this cultivation is impossible, multylocus sequence typing MLST approach will be used for their genetic characterization of Babesia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi s. l., B. miyamotoi, Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp, Ehrlichia spp. Bartonella spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis from animal reservoirs, ticks and humans. Another objective will be to map tick species, since they were investigated 40 years ago, and to confirm species with PCR and sequencing. Application of genetic typing of multiple genes allows a detailed differentiation of genotypes and their heterogeneity. In this way, the genetic variability of the isolates, their geographical distribution and population genetic structure, as well as transmission routes of various isolates within ticks and their natural reservoirs, will be defined. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|tick-borne pathogens, multilocus sequnce genotyping, pathogen distribution, animals, humans|

Especially difficult situation occurs when loading is stochastic (e.g. wind, earthquake, traffic) since there is no direct relation between loading (input) and displacements (output). System parameter identification will be based on inverse mathematical formulation so to present a reliable and theoretically sound procedure for identification of required parameters. One of the main goals of the system identification procedure is representative volume identification. It will be necessary to consider non-Gaussian stochastic processes with heavy tails characterizing dangerous rare events. Regarding material parameters this project advocates the hypothesis that the fracture energy of a material is approximately constant and that the material constitutive law should not incorporate “rate effect”. The idea of (approximately) constant fracture energy for all loading rates is new and important in models of concrete under the dynamic loading. Also, the inclusion of the viscous parameter in the existing 3D microplane model for concrete is of vital importance for fatigue analysis since it connects creep and shrinkage (internal material loading) with dynamic loading (external structural loading). In the end the developed concrete model will account for corrosion by coupling the mechanical properties of concrete and properties affecting the transport of humidity, oxygen and chloride (chemo-hygro-thermo-mechanical model). The calibration of the 3D model and its verification will be performed based on the simulation of the corresponding experimental tests from the laboratory and the available literature according to the procedure for system parameter identification described above. Two main characteristics of the project: highly applicative and at the same time capable of producing high impact scientific results. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|multi-scale, concrete, system identification, dynamic loading, computer model|

By exploring assemblies ranging from molecular to cellular sizes we are aiming at building a unified view of the principal mechanisms responsible for domain formation and destruction. This new approach hasn't been explored as such in similar research projects. In the project's first year, by molecular dynamic simulations, we will quantify micro-heterogeneity in liquids as a structural order that exists on the local scale and doesn't propagate on the global scale. As a continuation of the first-year results, we will study how the structure of the above mentioned liquids changes when dissolving molecules that promote or destroy domains defined by the local ordering. The used methods will be simulations and integral equation theory. In parallel with the molecular scale studies, the cellular membranes will be probed by means of experimental measurements and simulations. The aim will be to describe the mechanism of destruction of lipid bilayers induced by antimicrobial peptides. Principal investigator Larisa Zoranić has competencies to establish a new research group with an interdisciplinary subject and members of diverse fields because of her scientific background in physics, biology and biophysics. She has experience working in both international and Croatian groups, thus obtaining the required managing skills. The group's acquired knowledge and expertize will ensure a good quality start towards more demanding issues that stem from the project. The aims and methods of this research are competitive internationally in the area of molecular physics and biophysics. This kind of innovative project, built around an interdisciplinary group and having strong connections with the diploma and doctorate studies, will strengthen the Croatian scientific network. 					 				|	|Physics|	|associated liquids, micro-heterogeneity, molecular dynamics, integral equation theory, antimicrobial peptides|

In order to assess structural integrity as well as to predict structural lifetime, an analysis at microlevel is required. In recent years, a special attention has been directed to the investigation of relations between macroscopic properties of materials and their microstructure as well as to perform a link to atomistic scale. Since classical continuum mechanics cannot consider structural effects in the material at the micro- and nanolevel, multiscale techniques are developed that model material deformation responses at multiple levels using appropriate numerical procedures. Deformation responses of arteries will be considered by using multiscale computational strategy too. A special attention will be directed toward the mathematical modeling of arterial growth and remodeling, which could help physicians to track certain cardiovascular diseases and predict their development. For modeling of engineering materials, a new micro-macro numerical procedure based on the second-order computational homogenization approach employing nonlocal continuum theory will be proposed. Both finite element and meshless spatial discretization will be applied. The damage evaluation at the microlevel which may lead to macroscopic fracture will be modeled. Here the damage evaluation law based on the computational averaging procedure will be used and the modeling at atomistic scale will be performed in the very narrow domain of localization. In the atomistic modeling using molecular dynamics, a special attention will be directed to the coupling of atomistic domain with the discretized continuum domain. An approach inspired by the quasicontinuum and bridging domain will be proposed. All results of the research will be tested by the modeling deformation responses of realistic materials. 					 				|	|Basic engineering sciences|	|Engineering materials, bilogical tissues, multiscale modeling, finite element method, meshless method, damage modeling, molecular dynamics|

Two new self-assembly processes of Ge quantum dots in dielectric amorphous matrices and consequently novel material types have been discovered recently by our group. We have performed intensive investigation of their structural properties since then, and we had found that they appear in many different shapes, internal structures and ordering types. One material can store large amounts of Hydrogen. However, only properties of Ge and SiGe quantum dots have been investigated, while all other materials and their properties are completely unknown. These materials are theoretically very suitable for applications, especially in photo-electric conversion and energy storage, so the investigations of their properties related to the applications are also very important. We intend to form a group which will be excellent in production, characterization and application of these materials. Precisely, we intend to (i) further investigate the observed self-assembly processes and develop new material types with interesting or extraordinary structural properties; (ii) determine the basic optical and electrical properties of these materials and (iii) produce simple devices based on these materials for energy conversion and storage. We expect preparation of new, applicative materials with exceptional properties, observation of unusual effects caused by specific structure, and preparation of efficient thin-film coatings for conversion and storage of Sun energy. These results could be of great relevance for the production of super-efficient energy-converting window glasses, as the method that we use for the preparation (magnetron sputtering deposition), is a standard technique for production of window coatings and low-emissivity glasses. 					 				|	|Physics|	|Quantum dots, Self-assembly, Magnetron sputtering, Quantum dot crystal, Hydrogen storage, Energy conversion, Solar cell, Ion-beam irradiation|

For that reason the main objective is to preserve the quality of all available sources of drinking water. Among all the threats to water in nature, leachate landfills are most dangerous because of their complex chemical composition and continuous uncontrolled pollution of groundwater. Processes and methods of preventing the spread of pollution into groundwater and leachate treatment are a challenge for many researchers. This proposal should be a contribution to the landfill leachate treatment using natural zeolite as a reactive barrier. This material is available in nature, environmentally compatible, thermally and chemically stable, and possesses adsorption and ion exchange properties. Depending of the surface charge, zeolites can uptake organic and inorganic positive and negative species. The desired surface charge can be achieved by chemical modification using different methods at a controlled pH value. Modified zeolites should have significantly higher removal capacities and selectivity towards pollutants contained in the landfill leachate. These wastewaters are highly concentrated, have the most complex possible composition, contain low biodegradable organic matter (halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols), inorganic ions (Cl-, NH4+, SO42-,NO3-, NO2-,PO43-), and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Mn). Many of these components have shown excellent removal from modal solutions onto zeolite; therefore investigations will start with batch studies, continue in lab-scale fixed bed columns, and finally in scale-up and multi stage columns filled with different modified zeolites. The multi stage column performance should be carried out with real leachate collected from the regulated landfills in the Dalmatian region. The exhausted zeolite, saturated with organic and inorganic pollutants, can be thermally treated and disposed of in nature, or solidified into the cement matrix. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|natural zeolites, landfill leachate, column method, heavy metals, reactive barrier|

The relevance of the topic of neomythologism stems precisely from the crisis in fundamental scientific research and reliance on the phenomenon of irrationality which is happening in the contemporary world. Since there is a crisis in the field of major scientific concepts, man tries to look for answers in a new mythology, which is visible in all forms of cultural research (literary text, visual arts, film, discourse of advertising). This is why this project proposal offers launching of a new type of research into neomythologism. The focus of the proposed research is based on the corpus of Russian and other Slavic literatures, including Croatian, in theatre, visual arts, film culture and contemporary media in order to study and define the elements of neomythologizing, especially those of the myths of everyday life (the myth of youth, the myth of the end of the world, the myth of the family, the myth of a healthy diet). Collection of materials, preparation works, workshops and conferences about the myths of everyday life shall take into account all aspects of this challenging topic in order to research this phenomenon, as well as the concept of the mythical in different aspects of Slavic cultures which are historically interconnected with a common mythology. The aim of the project is, hence, to obtain new scientific knowledge about the phenomenon of neomythologism which, though observable, has not scientifically been considered. 					 				|	|Philology|	|neomythologism, contemporary science, Russian literature/culture, Croatian literature/culture, myth, everydayness, Slavic Studies, humanities|

Shaped by societies, the media also shape societies. This relationship engenders social change that is at the core of the current mediatisation process and theory debates (Schulz, 2004; Krotz, 2007; Hjarvard, 2008; Hepp, 2011). Networked communication technologies reshape the equilibrium of the media/society relationship and extend the mediatisation process to new directions. The process is not a straightforward technological impact, but a complex accommodation process. In this research we study how the public sphere (Habermas, 1991) has been reshaped through networked communication (Cardoso 2008). We focus on four aspects of mediatisation: extension, substitution, amalgamation and accommodation (Schulz, 2004) to study organizational changes in the process of media production; and media use and practices among internet users. The main objective is to understand processes of media production, consumption and their interrelations, with regard to public communication through new, online and networked media. Specific goals include contributions to development of the mediatisation theory; establishment of a classification of online media in Croatia; development of mixed methods research designs and providing impetus to related public policies. We employ a sequential, explorative research strategy (Creswell, 2009). In the first stage, we conduct multiple, qualitative case studies of the processes of organizational change in different online media. In the second, intermediary stage we construct survey questionnaires based on previous qualitative work. In the third stage, we use a survey on a national representative sample and provide further analytical conclusions derived from the research. The potential users of our research results include: scientific research communities, media industry, media organizations, policy decision-makers, regulatory institutions, and various NGOs. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|Networks, public communication, public sphere, mediatisation, new media, Croatia|

Therefore, there is a necessity for developing novel molecular approaches to treat this disease. Unlike other tumors, in melanoma p53 is relatively rarely mutated. However, overexpressed p53 fails to function as a tumor suppressor and tumor cells continue to proliferate and spread. This suggests that regulation of p53 activity depends on the interplay between p53 and its binding partners. Based on current state of knowledge, we hypothesize that p53 function in malignant melanoma might be altered through the interactions with p53 small molecular weight and p73 isoforms, nm23/NDPK and Gli families of proteins. Thus we will search for p53 protein binding partners in melanoma. The interactions identified by mass spectrometry will be further confirmed using microarray-based approaches and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. Furthermore, the expression profile of genes/proteins of interest in panel of melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue samples will be investigated. The potential impact of the identified p53 interacting partners on its transcriptional activity and the stimulation of apoptosis will be determined. The depletion of partners using siRNA technology would confirm the involvement of selected proteins on p53 activity. The subcellular localization of the proteins in complex will be revealed by advanced fluorescent microscopy methods on state-of-the-art instrumentation what would give us the insight on dynamics of their interactions. The proposed research could provide a possible explanation why p53 function in melanoma is abrogated. The aim of this project is to determine the complexity of p53 interactions and their role in the onset and progression of human melanoma and offer new, innovative solutions in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|melanoma, protein interactions, p53, p73, nm23, Gli|

The scientific approach is based on a combination of theoretical and experimental knowledge and experience of collaborators, and includes quantum-chemical calculations and molecular modelling in the molecular design, chemical synthesis and physico-chemical characterisation of molecules. The aim of project is to study fundamental physico-chemical properties of supramolecular systems built by non-covalent interactions (NC) - hydrogen bonding and metal-ligand coordination. The objectives are: a) Synthesis and structural characterization of functionalized bis-chromophoric molecular systems possessing guanidine, (thio)urea and carboxylate functionalities by employment of novel environmentally friendly synthetic methods; b) Detailed insight into the fundamental mechanisms how NC bonds mediate excited energy-transfer processes from one chromophore to another within assemblies; c) Analysis of influence of guanidine and (thio)urea functionalities and their anion complexation on the spectroscopic properties; d) Study of novel assemblies based on NC interactions and influence of different media; e) Development of model heterogeneous photo-responsive catalysis materials; f) Construction of complex multichromophoric supramolecular assemblies. Results of fundamental studies carried out within this project will enrich the understanding of physico-chemical factors in electron transfer processes in supramolecular systems constructed of chromophoric pairs employing the non-covalent bonding. Expected results will enable design of novel photoactive systems which could be applied in the technological development including sensors, fluorescent probes in biomedicine, organic photovoltaics, molecular electronics and heterogeneous catalysis. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|physical-organic chemistry, green chemistry, synthesis, computational chemistry, organic materials|

The present study plan aims the research towards the gene regulatory mechanisms that control hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) homeostasis and differentiation, which is tightly regulated by an interplay of a number of transcription factors and environmental signals mediated by a Notch signaling pathway. Our group designed an experimental approach for studying the interaction of Notch signaling pathway with transcription factor genes associated with hematopoiesis with focus on Ikaros gene family. Our laboratory has established a diagnostic technique for quick and sensitive detection of aberrant Notch and Ikaros forms by single cell multiplex qRT-PCR, which is a unique tool enabling us to dissect the contribution of different members of the Ikaros and Notch families on differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells in a context of regulation of expression of target genes as well as non-coding RNAs, since they maintain the spatial organization of chromosome structure and regulate cell commitment. Our results will improve diagnosis and risk stratification for leukaemia patients which will be an important aid in informed clinical decisions. Therefore the proposed project will substantially advance the field towards better therapeutic options and contribute significantly to the field of stem cell medicine. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|hematopoietic stem cells, leukemia, Notch, Ikaros, non-coding RNA,differentiation,|

Recent advent of detector arrays allows systematic studies of nuclei away from the region of nuclear stability. With the proper selection of colliding systems and reaction energies, the exchange of nucleons can lead to the population of neutron-rich nuclei, peculiar systems having challenging aspects in their nuclear structure behaviour. The main objective of this research project is to advance understanding of the nuclear reactions and structure in the vicinity of the neutron drip line. By the use of the new generation instrumentation, we will experimentally study three different neutron-rich groups of nuclei: very heavy nuclei (difficult to access experimentally with other methods), medium-mass nuclei (where well known magic numbers disappear), and finally, lower mass nuclei (were the neutron drip line has already been experimentally reached). The major part of the proposed experimental work will be performed at the top international accelerator facilities, but in the well suited cases, the measurements will be performed at the RBI accelerator. The new experimental data will significantly improve our understanding of nuclei far from the stability line and will have a considerable impact on the reaction measurements at next generation of the radioactive beam facilities. Scientists involved in this project are active members of a number of leading international collaborations in the field, with large experience in experimental research and considerable international reputation. Project PI has remarkable research track record and has led a successful project before. Senior scientists on the project have led a number of competitive projects (funded by MSES, FP7, ESF and Croatian SF). Finally, this project is well integrated with the strategic community document Long Range Plan of the Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee. 					 				|	|Physics|	|nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, neutron-rich nuclei, nucleon-nucleon correlations, nuclear pairing, nuclear clustering|

Croatian transformer manufacturers are among a top few in the world, and their annual production is worth about €300 million, what is about 2% of the world production. It is possible to keep this position on the world market only if there is a close collaboration between the academic community and transformer manufacturers. Notable progress in technology of transformers is based on utilization of new materials and application of advanced design methodologies, which incorporate sophisticated numerical methods for modelling of processes in transformers. This project is focused on research and development of advanced numerical techniques for solving various electromagnetic phenomena in transformers and their application in design. Crucial subjects in transformer design are: insulation system, electromagnetic losses and windings. Consequently, researches within this project are organized in three subprojects: 1. New methods for design of insulating systems. The aim of this subproject is to develop new comprehensive numerical method for computation of electric fields within the insulating system. 2. Computation of electromagnetic losses with the aim to develop a new method of estimation of stray losses level of power transformer, as well as the methodology of simultaneous modelling of electromagnetic field, thermal field and fluid dynamics field in transformers. 3. High frequency modelling of windings. The objective of this subproject is to develop fast and accurate procedures for the determination of capacitances, inductances and resistances in high-frequency range. These elements will be used for creating an equivalent lumped-element circuit for determination of voltage stresses along a winding. The overall goal is to reduce dimensions of transformers and to increase their reliability by application of new methods and procedures. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|numerical methods, transformers, insulation systems, lossess, high frequency modelling|

Being one of the first scientific mobile learning projects in Croatian schools, it explores both technology and pedagogies through two studies leveraging tablet computers in Croatian classrooms. In the first study, SCOLLAm will be deployed in a primary school to support new seamless and collaborative lessons in and across the existing subjects. In the second study, augmented mobile learning technology and the accompanying digital lessons will be used as a tool to support seamless and collaborative learning in a vocational school. These studies seek to stimulate and explore the effectiveness of mobile learning in Croatian schools in a strictly scientific manner, by engaging in digital mobile lesson co-design with the school teachers. The project will leverage experience from mobile learning research groups from Singapore, Sweden and USA in order to develop a new set of tools and lessons suitable for Croatian educational system. In order to move away from the tools typically targeting one platform and providing only limited adaptation mechanisms with virtually no learning analytics, one of the project objectives is the design, development and deployment of a scalable, adaptive and analytics driven platform SCOLLAm. Through the designed studies, produced open localizable educational resources and the SCOLLAm platform, we expect to see that the participants benefit from the introduction and use of mobile technology and applications through increased learning, collaboration skills and self-directedness, and acquire 21st century skills needed in their further education and life. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|seamless learning, mobile learning, technology enhanced learning, collaborative learning, informal learning, educational technology|

Models and computer programs for simulation of behavior steel dies during casting of light metal alloys and hot pressing of metal powders will be developed. During the thermal processes primary will be studied physical processes and material properties such as: heat transfer, microstructure transformations, mechanical properties and distortions and residual stresses. Numerical model of physical phenomena will be preferable based on finite volume method (FVM). To solve these tasks, joined thermo-mechanic-metallurgical approach will be required.

The first will include study of mechanisms of organic reactions in the solid state, and the second will mainly deal with the theoretical study of mechanisms in the solution. Mechanisms of the solid-state processes cannot be interpreted using the established concepts of reaction mechanisms because the phase change plays the crucial role in determining reaction kinetics and the structure of the products. Until now, papers published in this field represent mostly kinetics of phase transformations and descriptions of kinetic data by various mathematical models. As a result, the relationship between such a macroscopic approach and structural changes on the molecular level is still poorly understood. Knowledge about the principles of solid-state reactions is of broad interest, and especially useful to chemists who use solvent-free synthetic methods. In this research, we propose investigations of solid-state reactions based on our recent discoveries and explanations of mechanisms of dimerizations and polymerization of nitroso compounds. Using this established approach and corresponding molecular models, we plan to develop a mechanistic concept of the solid-state reactions, and use it to design novel supramolecular structures. As a starting point of our investigations of organic reaction mechanisms in the solution, we will finish development of our new cluster-continuum solvation model. It will provide us with the most important solute-solvent molecules clusters, allowing the realistic estimates of standard Gibbs energies of involved species and thus prediction of kinetic and thermodynamic data for the examined reactions. The approach will be tested on several model problems, and then used for the analysis of several representative organic mechanisms, including the ones occurring in solids. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|reaction mechanisms, solvent effects, solid-state reactions, molecular self-assembly, nitroso compounds, ferrocenes|

The project will focus on studying two major pesticide classes with three subgroups per each: (A) insecticides (organophosphates, neonicotinoids, and pyrethroids), (B) herbicides (triazines, organophosphates, allelopathic), and persistent organochlorine pollutants under the Stockholm convention. Low concentrations corresponding to real-life exposures will be evaluated based on residential exposure levels, occupational exposure limits, acceptable daily intakes, and reference doses in appropriate cell lines and animal models. The malsegregation of chromosomes (X, Y, 9), integrity of gatekeeping genes (TP53, c-Myc), and protein structures (cytoskeleton components) will be studied within the transplacental genotoxic evaluation of selected pesticide groups. Among these, some are suspected to be endocrine disruptors. Potential effects on sex hormone levels will be assessed in neonatal rats and transfer via mother’s milk in pubertal rats. Oxidative stress will be estimated by measuring lipid peroxidation and activity of antioxidative enzymes in vitro and in vivo. We will study the processes affecting the distribution of pesticides in water/soil systems as well as the genotoxicity of their residues in soil and water. Results for low levels of pollutant exposure will serve to significantly extend the knowledge on their genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, sex endocrine disruption, mechanisms of oxidative stress, and distribution in the environment. Also, they will be used as a base for amending and adopting the Croatian National Action Plan for sustainable use of pesticides in accordance with demands postulated in Directive 2009/128/EC and the EU Thematic Strategy for Pesticides. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|pesticides, organochlorine pollutants, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton, environmental distribution, risk assessment|

Graphene can withstand rather large elastic deformation and it appears that within the elastic response there is a range of different modifications in graphene’s electronic structure. This is a basis of what is called “strain engineering”. Recent theoretical calculations suggest that uniaxial strain or shear deformations can induce opening of the electron band gap, anisotropic modification of the Fermi velocity, spin-orbit interaction and consequently alter the transport properties. However, there is still no consensus on the mechanical conditions required to obtain a particular electronic modification. In this project we propose a systematic study of structural and electronic properties of periodically rippled graphene. We have already demonstrated that graphene conforms to the stepped (vicinal) iridium surface – Ir(332) creating periodic structure at nanometer scale. It is aim of this project to experimentally explore the dependence of the electronic structure of graphene with respect to periodicity of the graphene corrugation, orientation of the graphene with respect to the shear deformation (zig-zag with respect to armchair direction). By intercalation of different elements we will alter the graphene substrate interaction with the aim to control the structure of the underlying surface and consequently valence band structure of graphene. We shall investigate structural properties of graphene on Ir(332) by Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The focus in the investigation of electronic properties will be on the ARPES study of anisotropic distortion of the Dirac cone, relation with the direction of the graphene modulation, spin-orbit interaction and on the possibility to induce electron band gap. 					 				|	|Physics|	|graphene, strain, vicinal surface, fermi velocity, spin-orbit coupling, STM, ARPES|

Bene Nižić|	|In high energy particle physics it is widely believed that the energy frontier experiments at LHC and the planned linear colliders, ILC and/or CLIC, together with ongoing and new experiments in neutrino and flavour physics will unravel fundamental problems in particle and astroparticle physics. A prerequisite for this progress is the complete understanding of the Standard model (SM) predictions. One of the triumphs of SM physics has been the extent to which QCD successfully describes strong interaction processes observed at colliders. More accurate QCD calculations are nowadays essential in understanding the enormous amount of available high-precision data, particularly since new physics effects are obscured by standard QCD processes. Our focus in that area will be to improve the description of hard exclusive processes by including higher-order contributions and by further developing the corresponding methods for automatic QCD calculations. Furthermore, we plan to do precision studies of top-quark production and decay observables which provide a unique view to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, important for understanding of particle mass generation. In the top-quark decay the information about its spin polarization imprinted by the production process is preserved, and can be calculated and measured in angular distributions of decay products providing other way to search for deviations from the SM expectations. Regarding new physics, the fact that neutrinos have a mass already requires an extension of the SM and calls for an understanding of the origin of neutrino masses. The seesaw mechanism, included in a theory as the one where left-right symmetry (parity) is restored at accessible LHC energies, stands out as a prominent theoretical candidate, and this theory links the origin of neutrino masses to new interactions at high energies and to the restoration of parity. A phenomenological investigation of these predictions is thus compelling and timely. 					 				|	|Physics|	|theoretical particle physics, Standard Model, perturbative calculations, physics beyond Standard Model, neutrinos|

Primary research focus is on the genetic basis of body shape and facial features, based on an innovative approach to produce large number of measurements from the 3-dimensional body and face scanning. In order to achieve this aim, we will perform 3D scanning of 2,000 healthy subjects from the island of Korcula, within one of the largest biomedical research resources in Croatia – the 10,001 Dalmatians biobank. Besides excellent genotyping and sequencing opportunities, the inclusion of subjects from the isolated island populations facilitates gene discovery and enables the search for the rare genetic variants. After completion of genome-wide association and exome analysis, we will also use gene networking and pathway analysis tools, as well as the advanced analytic tools, such as random forest, lasso regression and partial least squares regression in order to produce results that can be translated to clinical medicine, fitness and beauty, as well as legal medicine and forensics. Progress over the existing research designs will also be achieved by inclusion of extensive confounding information and family structure into analysis. All these findings will also be investigated in follow-up measurements and linked with the morbidity and mortality information in the future, thus further developing a coherent resource capable of producing highly competitive research results. With the excellent track record of the principal investigator, outstanding institutional support and well-established research team experienced in computational genomics and field work, this project will provide a substantial step forward over the existing state-of-the-art studies that rely on simple genomic associations, yet manage to publish their results in the top-end journals. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|Genomics, anthropometrics, 3 dimensional, exome, analysis|

Further dissemination will follow in form of terminology workshops and seminars throughout Croatia. This interdisciplinary project will be achieved through intensive cooperation of musicologists and linguists, which will ensure a high level of linguistic normativity along with musicological aptness.

Aberrant P signaling has been associated with reproductive conditions, cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular defects, and neurological defects. In humans and mice the physiological effects of P are mediated by two intracellular receptors, termed PR-A and PR-B, expressed in subset of cells in target tissues. PR-A and PR-B isoforms are transcribed from a single gene by alternative promoter usage. PR-A (94 kD) isoform differ from PR-B (120 kD) by lacking 164 amino acids at the N terminus . Analyses to date have shown that PR-A and PR-B mediate mostly distinct but partially overlapping reproductive tissue selective physiological responses to P. The overall objective of this research is to establish the selective physiological roles of each of the individual PR isoforms in their natural physiological context. For this research we will use a genetically modified mouse in which gene targeting was used to knockout expression of either the PR-A or PR-B isoform in mice. The specific aims of this application are as follows: 1. To examine the isoform-selective molecular mechanisms by which PR-A and PR-B differentially regulate uterine epithelial proliferation, uterine receptivity and stromal decidualization. 2. To examine the selective contributions of the PR-A and PR-B isoforms to the P dependent immunomodulatory activity during early pregnancy. 3. To identify progesterone-regulated genes in musculoskeletal tissue using a genetically altered mouse models lacking progesterone receptors. 4. To determine whether differential signaling pathways of PR isoforms are conserved from rodent to human. It is expected that this research will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of P in reproductive tissues and musculoskeletal and could lead to new strategies for disease prevention and treatment. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|Progesterone, progesterone receptors, uterus, bone, physiology, pathophysiology, animal model, human|

As the first experiences with SEM almost invariably precede first sexual experiences, concerns have been raised about its potential impact on young people’s sexual socialization, subsequent reproductive and sexual health outcomes, as well as motivation and capacity for building and maintaining relationship intimacy. The field of socio-behavioural research on SEM has been marred by inability to distinguish between associations and causal links. The only available European panel study followed Dutch youth for only 12 months. To enable a more robust assessment of the links between SEM use and sexual socialization, health, and intimacy we propose to set up a 3-year panel sample with over 1,000 high-school students. The panel would be used to carry out biological testing on males (testosterone levels from saliva) and repeated online surveying in which the genre and the frequency of SEM use would be analyzed as predictors of subsequent sexual activity (particularly, sexual risk taking), the dynamics of attitudes toward women and committed relationships. We propose to test a conceptual model in which possible SEM influences on the outcomes are influenced by T levels, personality traits, family environment, characteristics of ego-centered social network, type of SEM used, and sexual experiences. Our biopsychosocial model aims to assess the contribution of SEM use to the process of young people’s sexual socialization, while controlling for the effects of biological makeup, intrapersonal characteristics, and interpersonal and group (family, peer group, partners) social influences. The proposed project is innovative in design and analytical conceptualization. The expected outcomes should be relevant not only in scientific terms but also in the context of public policy, particularly in the area of educational and public health interventions. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|Prospective study, panel, young people, reproductive and sexual health, emotional intimacy, committed relationships, sexually explicit material|

Biomarkers have the potential to identify key disease indicators at the individualised level, as well as to detect a disease at the early-stages before the development/advance of a serious illness. The emergence of innovative, post-genomic technology, like proteomics, led to the development of strategies aimed at identifying altered, sensitive biomarkers specific to the disease among thousands of molecules present in biological samples. Blood and urine contains multitude, unstudied, and unknown biomarkers, particularly in low-molecular region of blood and urine proteome. Babesiosis, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM), and chronic valvular disease (CVD-MV) in dogs are common and serious disease. The aims of the project is: to discover novel, early-stage biomarkers of kidney and cardiac disease in dogs which could lead toward more precise and adequate diagnose, prognosis, and monitoring of these diseases; to perform a proteomic analysis on the sera and urine of dogs with uncomplicated and complicated form of babesiosis, as well as dogs with diagnosed iDCM and CVD-MV in order to identify novel, early-stage diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers; to expand the pathway signalling research in order to improve the understanding of pathogenesis for studied disease; to validate new biomarkers for studied diseases. Tthese expected scientific outcomes will contribute in practice: (a) in a short term view, to detect individualised molecular fingerprints; to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of iDCM, CVD-MV, and babesiosis, as well as potential targets for novel approaches to monitor the therapies of these diseases; to enable the ability to personalise the treatment of individual patients resulting in enhanced patient care; and (b) in a long-term view, to allow entry of proteomics in clinical veterinary medicine in Croatia and transfer of knowledge in –omics- technologies in other parts of veterinary medicine. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|biomarkers, dog, proteomics, kidney, heart, babesiosis, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic valvular disease|

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that colonizes one half of the world population and it is regarded as one of the most invasive human pathogens responsible for development of many diseases. There are two possible pathways that organisms can use to synthesize purines as indispensable building blocks for DNA and RNA synthesis. However, bacterium H. pylori uses the salvage pathway, only. Therefore, we plan to disable H. pylori growth and replication by inhibiting the key enzymes, purine nucleoside phosphorylase and adenylosuccinate synthetase, on this pathway. The proposed project includes the interdisciplinary team with expertise in the research areas of molecular biology and genetics, biochemistry and biophysics, macromolecular crystallography, biological mass spectrometry, molecular modelling, organic synthesis, analytical ultracentrifugation methods, susceptibility testing, and managing ‘big data’ through data integration (extracted from various databases).

It presents the essence of nanoscience and hence is a cornerstone for the production of advanced materials and devices. The scope of this project is to explore semiconductor nanoparticles in 0-dim, so called quantum dots (QDs), which are the building blocks for advanced materials. We shall study QDs made of different semiconductors embedded in various dielectric materials. The main intention is to explore many of basic physical properties of such systems which are not clear yet and hence prevent their successful development and application. The several key issues that we shall explore are: a) the process of nucleation and growth of QDs, their self-assembly and self-organization. We shall study experimentally and theoretically nucleation growth and crystallinity of different QDs in various dielectrics, and possibility of superstructures formation. Once formed QDs present several serious challenges. The interface QD/dielectric and/or the structure of dielectric layers close to QDs as well as its impact on optical and electrical properties is still completely obscured. In this respect we shall study radiative and nonradiative recombinations of carriers in this region by PL and TRPL. A special effort will be given to theoretical modelling of interfaces, defect formation on such interfaces modeled with molecular dynamics and attempts to describe the transport properties with such modelling. Finally, electronic properties of such composite material will be explored by transport measurements and compared to several simulation models. Several models of unbiased and biased percolation will be explored and applied to this problem. Finally, formation of metal nanoparticles and their plasmonic effect will be explored and analyzed as a special approach to the light management. 					 				|	|Physics|	|nanoscience, quantum dots, percolation conductivity, tunneling, photoluminescence, scanning probe microscopy, small angle x-ray scattering, modeling,|

Iva Babić|	|Interdisciplinary scientific study of paleoclimate and paleoenvironment is of the great importance for prediction of future climate and environmental changes. Croatia occupies a key position between eastern and western Mediterranean basins and delimits central European and the Mediterranean regions influenced by different climates. Dinaric karst, covering half of the Croatian territory, offers exquisite potential for such a research, having the wide range of karstic forms already proven as good (paleo)environmental archives, such as terrestrial and submerged speleothems, tufa deposits and lake sediments in karstic lakes and marine algal rims in the coastal area. Within this research various carbonate sediments from different climate zones will be studied: speleothems from 3 locations in littoral Croatia, mountainous Gorski Kotar region and central Croatia, lake sediments from Plitvice Lakes, tufa deposits from Zrmanja River, and marine algal rims from ~8 locations along the eastern Adriatic coast. Research will be based on isotopic methods that include analyses of stable isotope ratios 13C/12C and 18O/16O in carbonate deposits, 2H/1H and 18O/16O in water, and radioactive isotopes 14C and U-Th series for dating. Stable isotopes in carbonates will provide information about past environmental conditions, temperature variations, lake evaporation, bioactivity and productivity, and indicate the origin of carbon and mechanisms of calcite precipitation. Algal rims serve as good and precise sea-level indicators and additionally their morphology, age and stable isotope composition could be directly linked to climate changes. The expected outcome is the estimation of regional response of the environment in Croatia to global changes during the Quaternary, and of differences in response of various carbonates to paleoenvironmental changes and their correlations. The project combines groups from Ruđer Bošković Institute, Faculty of Science (Univ. of Zagreb), and University of Zadar. 					 				|	|Geology|	|paleoclimate, paleoenvironment, Quaternary, speleothem, algal rim, tufa, lake sediment, stable isotopes, 14C dating, U-Th series dating|

Targeted samples are unexplored or insufficiently investigated honeys, honeydews, bee-products, wines, cheese, others. While characteristic NPs (secondary metabolites) already possess flavours, other flavour compounds can derive from precursors during processing, fermentation, dry-curing, heating, others (e.g. Maillard reactions, Strecker degradations, retro-aldol reactions, Amadori rearrangements, heterocyclizations, lipid oxidations and others). NPs/FLs isolation involves application of selective preparative procedures followed by the organic analysis applying modern chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Specific project goal is to determine reliable chemical fingerprints of targeted samples depending on biodiversity of natural sources in different regions. Varieties of acetate, shikimate, mevalonate and/or deoxyxylulose biosynthetic pathway derivatives are expected to be found. Among them, it can be possible to find specific or nonspecific chemical biomarkers characterizing certain sources. In addition, the obtained NPs or selected samples will be evaluated in order to unlock their potential, particularly antioxidant activity by different assays and corrosion inhibition potential with in-situ and ex-situ electrochemical/non-electrochemical techniques. Project work plan includes: 1) the samples selection and preliminary characterisation; 2) set-up of preparative/chromatographic/spectroscopic methods followed by elaboration of the obtained chemical fingerprints); 3) set-up of antioxidant/corrosion inhibition assays followed by unlocking the samples/NPs potential; 4) training of young researchers/cooperation. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|natural products, flavours, preparative techniques, chromatography, spectroscopy, antioxidant assays, corrosion inhibition assays|

Adequate wastewater management implies collection and treatment of wastewater, but also adequate management of waste substances generated in the treatment process. Joining the European Union Croatia has made the commitment to construct all treatment plants of capacities over 10.000 PE by 2018. This will result in putting into operation of treatment plants with the total load of about 4.000.000 PE (250.000.000 m3 of wastewater), which will generate about 215.000 tons per year of raw sewage sludge and after incineration around 49.000 tons per year of incinerated sewer sludge ash (ISSA). Taking into account that EU Directives are limiting the amount of sewage sludge waste to be landfilled, and Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) puts reuse and recycling of waste into the most favorable position, it is evident that enormous amount of ISSA will become available for appropriate management. The composition of the generated sewage sludge and ISSA is dependent on the technology of wastewater and sludge treatment. Reviewing the available knowledge in this field leads to the conclusion that the influence of the method of incineration on physical properties of ISSA and the technology of preparing and processing of concrete and concrete elements has not been fully analysed. The main objective of the project is to investigate the possibilities of recycling the sludge from WWTPs in preparing of new innovative products in concrete industry. Based on comprehensive experimental research and multidisciplinary knowledge of the partners (hydrotecnical, materials and chemical engineering), a strategy will be proposed for the comprehensive and sustainable management of ISSA and its transformation from unwanted waste material into valuable resource for production of construction products with ecological, economical and technological benefits. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|Wastewater treatment, Sewage sludge, ISSA, Concrete, Microstructure, Sustainable materials|

An impressive number of settlements of this type can be found in Istria, representing an interesting scientific and important cultural phenomenon. Most of the hillforts were established during the Bronze Age, and due to population increase and social stratification they were transformed from simple settlements into pre- and proto-urban centres. While the ethnic identity of the Bronze Age population is still unknown, the ethnically uniform population of the Histri inhabited these settlements during the Iron Age. After the Roman conquest of Istria most hillforts were abandoned; some of them remained in use, but under different circumstances and conditions which led to their substantial modification. Despite the large number of these sites (240 confirmed, 200 hypothetical), few of them were systematically excavated. Previous research was limited to intra-site interpretation and to targeted field survey. The main goals of this project are to identify anthropogenic landscape change at the time of the conversion of site function, and to obtain new insights on the spatial organisation of settlements and their relationships with the surrounding environment. Landscape studies, geoarchaeology, topography and archaeology will be integrated under interdisciplinary GIS environment, providing a new holistic interpretation of past landscape dynamics. This research will fill the gap in the understanding of human-landscape interaction and of anthropic transformation of land from Late Prehistory to Roman times. A case study on human impact on landscape will be conducted in the micro-region of Poreč, and will be explained within its broader regional context. The project will also provide training for young researchers involved in PhD programmes, giving them the chance to develop interdisciplinary skills and encouraging them to become successful independent scientists. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Istria, prehistoric hillfort, ancient landscape, roman villa, geoarchaeology, GIS, spatial analysis|

From Late Hellenistic period when Central Dalmatia was enrolled in vivid Mediterranean trade, not only as a receiver of everything that comes from the larger centre, but also as a driving force of social and economic changes establishing pottery manufactures. This social transformation was enhanced by Romans. Trade of ceramic objects is one of the main starting points for understanding the history of the Roman economy and society. For such scientific research it is necessary to establish a project using archaeometric analysis and archaeological research and a database of ceramics. Landscape archaeology methods such as field surveys, GIS, sampling patterns and statistical analysis will be used to analyse and interpret the wealth of data. RED project will include the development of an online database of documentary, archaeological material and archaeometric samples. Aim of this project will also be to establish relations between local production to the imports and to what extent was production in province Dalmatia driven by consumer demand and involvement of provincial communities within the Late Hellenistic/Republican and Imperial Roman economy. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Roman economy, Dalmatia, pottery, landscape archaeology, archaeometry|

First one is Water System of Salona, capital of Roman province Dalmatia, from the 1st century, and the second one is of Diocletian's Palace in Split from 4th century. The study will consist of analysis and reconstruction of two, by its purpose, different Water System, one of typical urban character and another very specific of Emperor Palace. Unlike the Water System of the Palace, which is partly preserved (aqueduct is in function) and therefore more studied, the Water System of Salona is mostly unknown. They will be studied separately using the same methodology. All parts of Water Supply system will be studied: water intake on Jadro spring, route and elements of the aqueduct (channel, bridges and tunnels), water distribution tanks, lead pipe network and water appliances together with water quantity and quality issues. The study of sewage will consider wastewater and storm water drainage, as well as the protection from external surface water and groundwater. Besides those, methods, materials and techniques used by Roman engineers to establish efficient urban Water System indispensable for the life and health of the citizens will be analyzed and compared with modern system. The study will be based on collecting all data regarding explored elements of the Water System and on new archaeological excavations financed by this project. Existing topographic and architectonic surveys will be summarized and supplemented by new ones which will enable reconstruction of the whole system and elements. The project team is multidisciplinary and gathers civil engineers, architects and archaeologist. Apart from new knowledge about the planning, building and maintaining Roman Water Systems this project will give necessary data to protect elements of the system form devastation, to make a proper presentation and even to put some elements is use. 					 				|	|Architecture and Urban Environment|	|Urban water system, Salona, Diocletian's palace, Aqueduct, Sewage|

The advantages offered by new digital and communication media are not sufficiently exploited to enhance communication in the classroom, and the course books available to students of elementary and secondary schools are not appropriate to the students' needs and expectations. The main aim of the planned research is to explore the attitudes and (self-)evaluation of teachers, school principals (managers), parents and students about the specific traits of the existing didactical paradigm (teacher-centred education) that still dominates in Croatian schools, and to explore the possible didactical solutions for internal reform that focuses on student-centred education based on contemporary theories of teaching and learning and the possibility to enrich education with ICT. Empirical non-experimental, quasi-experimental, and action research is planned. The following methods of data collection will be used during the research: questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, systematic observation, case studies, and content analysis. A number of stratified student samples (N=3000), teacher samples (N=600) and school principals (N=300) from different counties in the Republic Croatia will be used for data collection.

The breed is black in color, resistant and convenient for keeping in extensive and half-extensive conditions. It is also characterized by good meat quality, suitable for producing typical traditional meat products. Recently, the traditionally produced food came into the focus which led to more often use of geographical indications (protected designation of origin-PDO, protected geographical indication-PGI and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed-TSG) as the valuable rural development strategy. Since Black Slavonian pig is a late maturing breed characterized by low lean meat percentage, meat processors tend to use the meat of modern pig breeds in production of traditional products. Therefore there is a need for scientifically developed methods in order to trace the origin of materials used in such production. First of all, molecular identification of breed will be performed by the use of MC1R gene and 18 microsatelite primers . Since the genotype, age and sex are possible sources of variation of the meat quality traits in pigs, the objective of proposed research is to determine the optimal time for slaughter with respect to these factors. The genetic influence on meat quality traits is nowadays well described by the use of molecular markers by which many of the candidate genes were discovered. In proposed research a special interest will be placed at some of them such as IGF2, MC4R, H-FABP3 and LEPR. The investigation of sensory traits and chemical analysis of meat and meat products will help to determine the typical physico-chemical characteristics and sensory profile of autochthonic Slavonian dry-cured meat products and fresh meat originated from Black Slavonian Pig meat. At the end, obtained polymorphisms at the microsatellite loci will be tested in identification of the origin of meat used in the production of traditional meat products. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|indigenous pig breed, genomic identification, growth characteristics, carcass and meat quality, sensory traits, meat products, branding|

There is a constant growth of this trend in Croatia, whereby certain areas, or to be more precise, the coastal area is more exposed to second homes expansion. This increase in pressure of second homes and the tendency of this phenomenon to change and take new forms, especially under the influence of the expected growth of international second homes and disappearance of the hierarchy in the use of dwellings, have directed the planned project towards one question: are second homes only an obstacle, or could they be a source of opportunities, i.e. an additional impulse to the social sustainability of local communities in Croatia. The main objectives of the project are: 1) Identifying settlements in Croatia with an increased number of second homes; 2) Determining types of settlements in Croatia, and getting an insight into the connection of second homes to relevant sociodemographic and socioeconomic features of the settlers; and 3) Analysing how second homes affect the daily life of the local community, social structures and processes in it.

It is based on empirical/interpretative, theoretical/analytical, and theoretical/numerical approach, and concerns all astrophysical problems currently in focus of the research at the Hvar Observatory (HO) of the Faculty of Geodesy of the University of Zagreb. Thus, the proposed program is in a great deal determined by, and directed towards, effective exploitation of the observational capacities and manpower of HO. The project is divided into five thematic topics: 1) solar activity and eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere; 2) solar-activity impact on the Earth; 3) stellar eruptive activity; 4) radiation processes in solar and stellar atmospheres; 5) exoplanets and substellar companions. In the first topic special attention is devoted to the research of the physics of coronal mass ejections and solar flares, since they drive the most intense geomagnetic storms, as well as changes of radiation belts and ionosphere. The central issue of the second topic is the influence of the solar variability on the Earth climate. The third topic is devoted to stellar eruptive magnetic-field activity, aiming to provide a better understanding of the long-term evolutionary aspect of the solar activity. The fourth topic is an important subject not only for astrophysics, but also for plasma physics in general, since it provides an alternative view on plasma instabilities and emission processes. The fifth topic is a timely astrophysical theme, since it provides new insights into physics of planetary systems, and is very important subject for understanding of the solar-system formation and evolution. 					 				|	|Physics|	|solar activity, space weather, climate, heliosphere, sun-like stars, variable stars, binary stars, accretion discs, exoplanets, substellar companions|

Achieved models and tools for investigation enable wider application of results in economy. Furthermore, Quaternary deposits are direct results of ancient climatic conditions and hence understanding them can help interpreting and predicting actual events. The goal of this Installation Research Project is to establish a group of researchers in the Croatian Geological Survey (CGS), Department of Geology, to additionally equip and train them, so they could standardise and carry out their research of Quaternary sediments of Croatia applying new analytical techniques and new scientific findings. Those new compositional data will enable correlating our results with the EU, especially for the middle and south Europe. In this project we would like to deal with Quaternary sediments on the both regions: Pannonian and Dinaric. During the first year we plan to get know new equipment, methodology and to investigate all the different types of Quaternary sediments in Croatia. In the second and third year plan is to scrutinize the sediments in selected area in the each region (Pannonian and Dinaric). The strategic importance of Quaternary sediments for Croatia is based partly on the agricultural utilization of the Holocene soils developed on these deposits and partly as a collector of drinking water, reflecting to the whole biosphere. Furthermore, the hydrogeological properties of separate horizons of Quaternary sediments are different, so, insight in the structures of sediment layers could lead to finding new water resources. 					 				|	|Geology|	|Quaternary, litostratigraphical unites, Croatia, spatial distribution, climate proxies|

Project team members are leading reserachers from Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonian HEIs, researchers from the corporate world, and National Bank of Croatia. Prinicipal investigator and researchers have identified number of goals as significant for the crisis prevention and economic growth, which cannot be achieved without the insight acquired as a result of thoughtful statistical analysis. Crisis prevention topics will be investigated: Risk and financial management modelling, Commitment to business ethics and its influence on a corporation's performance, Efficiency of macroprudential measures and measuring financial stability, and Statistical modelling of the impact of macroeconomic shocks on small open economy. Economic growth topics will be investigated: Statistical modelling of housing wealth effect on personal consumption in selected WB countries, Modelling migration from the EU candidate countries, Impact of statistical methods usage to business performance, Estimating the value of public goods in tourism: Application of Contingent Valuation Method on the Case of Croatia, Strategic impact of the Internet usage on the tourism industry, and The net effect of bank market power in CEE countries.

We commonly use stochastic models to describe such behaviour and rely on stochastic methods to gain insights, make forecasts or inference about them. Various stochastic methods have appeared over the years in biology, medicine, biomedicine, geology, climatology, social sciences, finance and insurance, and many other scientific fields. The area of mathematics that lies in the background is probability theory, in particular, theory of stochastic processes. It is a rich mathematical theory with proven potential to solve not only applied problems, but also some quite theoretical problems coming from other areas of mathematics. The problems that we plan to study can be broadly divided into four groups: 1. Analysis and potential theory of Markov processes, 2. Stochastic methods in modelling heavy tailed phenomena, 3. Stochastic methods in harmonic analysis, and 4. Stochastic methods in biomedical and social sciences problems. This choice of problems is influenced by importance in the current international research as well as the background and expertise of members of our team. The goal of the project is to advance understanding of the role of randomness in each of these four settings. The unifying feature behind our approach to these problems is common stochastic methods in their analysis. These methods include, but are not limited to, martingale methods, point processes and random measure methods, potential-theoretic methods (both probabilistic and analytic), Markov processes methods, methods from the Dirichlet form theory, stochastic integrals, diffusion processes, branching processes and measure-valued processes methods, time-series methods, wavelets and methods for statistical inference. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|stochastic methods, stochastic processes, Markov processes, martingales, heavy tails, point processes, branching processes|

It is of great importance to speed up this process and to connect the available data to other regions in central-eastern Europe. It is especially important to connect central Balkan regions with Carpathian basin for better understanding of emergence and development of societies in various prehistoric periods. So far, the ways of communication between these regions were not of primary interest of archaeological scientific work. The complete work in defined area, combining field survey, trial excavations and data concerning natural resources, hasn’t been done. The goal of this project is the recognition of strategic points of settlement in prehistory and later periods and reconstruction of ways of communication. The project will concern itself with the area of municipalities Našice, Podgorač, Drenje and Koška (Drava region). This area is recognized as a potential crossroad of ways of communication of our interest. The work will be divided into 4 stages including field survey, trial excavations, data collection from geological maps and satellite images, combining data, web site construction and presenting the results in form of exhibitions, conferences, lectures etc. The final publication will be made presenting goals, collected data, the final results and list of museum activities.

Phase diagrams of layered cuprate, organic superconductors and manganites, as well as some other transition-metal systems, famous for the phenomena of unconventional superconductivity (SC) and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), respectively feature an extraordinary complexity of electronic phases, which can be tuned by chemical composition, magnetic field and pressure. A prominent place among these phases is held by stripes, patterns of charge order (CO), which are thought to be linked to SC and CMR, as well as by CO phases with ferroelectric signatures due to a rich variety of nonlinear properties and complex dynamics. Despite intense research efforts, these basic issues in condensed matter physics bear many open questions. We propose to investigate the nature of charge/spin-ordered phases and their motion developed in series of organic and transition metal solids applying modern experimental tools available at the Institute of Physics, Zagreb and at the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb (dielectric spectroscopy, pulsed nonlinear conductivity, ac/dc resistance, magnetoresistance and Hall effect). Our overall contributions to the field and our expertise in condensed matter physics have been internationally recognized. Together with the available experimental means, this positions us as researchers fully suitable and competent for the proposed task. Our international partners will give an added value with samples, experiments and expertise in the terahertz and infrared spectroscopy. Integrated students and postdocs are going to acquire advanced skills in the materials science and learn to solve complex problems in a collaborative environment. Results will be published in international scientific journals and presented at international conferences. 					 				|	|Physics|	|correlated electrons, unconventional superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, charge and spin orderings, quantum spin liquids, nonlinear effects|

Importance of negative hyperconjugation, contribution of the leaving group to the height of the reaction intrinsic barrier, importance of the inductivity and resonance as well as solvation will be analyzed. Series of substituted phenyl and alkyl carbonates, phosphates, phenolates, sulfates, phosphorous ylides, quaternary ammonium salts, etc. will be subjected to solvolysis in aqueous solvents and the rate constants will be correlated with the electrofugalities of the generated carbocations by applying a special LFER equation: log k = sf (Nf + Ef). To detect changes of the C—H bond strength in the TS, secondary deuterium KIEs will be determined. The rates of the backward combination reactions in some cases will be measured, which will provide a complete free energy profile of some reactions. The Marcus intrinsic barriers will be calculated and analyzed. The existing electrofugality scale will be extended with other aromatic (e.g. ferocenyl) as well as non-aromatic electrofuges by introducing the correction factors for the solvolysis rates. Such extended electrofugality scale, not limited to aromatic derivatives only, will allowed estimation of the heterolysis rates for wide range of compounds. The quantum-chemical model will be developed which mimics heterolysis reactions and whose barriers for variety of leaving groups correlate well with experimental barriers obtained with benzhydryl derivatives (?G‡calc vs ?G‡exp). By applying this correlation, the nucleofugality scale will be extended considerably and estimation of the rate constants for SN1 solvolysis of numerous leaving groups will be enabled. Such interplay of the theoretical calculations and experiment will allow prediction of the reactivity of a huge number of new nucleofuges, which have not been used earlier, as well as design of the substrates with required reactivity. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|nucleofugality, electrofugality, kinetics, solvolysis, reactivity|

This can also be used to develop more rational rules and regulations related to the traffic of large ships operating in the Adriatic and to investigate possibilities of a ship structural design improvement with respect to the most dangerous incident types. Despite advancements in navigation systems, ship accidents continue to occur, the most recent one being the grounding of a cruise ship Costa Concordia. These accidents have resulted in the loss of cargo, pollution of environment, and most unfavorable the loss of life. Accidental damages of ships can occur in any number of ways. The two cases which exhibit most concerns are the collision between ships and hard grounding on seabed. When a ship is damaged, the operators need to decide on immediate repair actions by evaluating the effects of the damage on safety of the ship by considering simultaneously effects of the damage in the hull girder ultimate bending moment and in the applied loads (wave and still-water induced bending moments). In general, as the consequence of an accident still water loads on ship will considerably increase, while the ship strength will decrease. Disaster of the tanker Prestige in 2002 clearly showed that the ship in damaged condition can be broken due to the above mentioned phenomenon and sink as the most unfavorable outcome of such an accident with likely spillage of a large amount of pollutant oil on board. Since the Adriatic is an enclosed sea basin, with the low level of the activity of the sea waves and current, an accident of the oil tanker with significant oil spill would make irreversible ecological disaster with enormous economic losses. Therefore, safety of oil transportation in the Adriatic is a major concern of the whole society. 					 				|	|Naval architecture|	|oil tanker, Adriatic sea, damaged ship, structural reliability, risk assessment|

Adela Štimac|	|The aim of this project proposal is supramolecular synthesis of self-assembled functional materials and study thus created complex chemical systems. Such systems exhibit a complex array of morphologies and dynamics and have a huge potential for new applications in areas ranging from materials science to medicine. The bottom–up synthesis of highly complex functional materials from simple modular blocks is an intriguing area of research. These hierarchically assembled systems extend beyond the individual molecule and rely on non-covalent interactions in a directed self-assembly process. Intrinsic properties of the materials can be modified by exploiting dynamic and specific uni-directional interactions among building blocks, thus allowing construction of novel supramolecular structures. These supramolecular networks belong to a novel category of soft biomaterials exhibiting attractive properties. Research in this project will include the formation of dynamic polymeric networks through molecular recognition and complex assembly formation. Self-assembly of small organic molecules is a suitable method for synthesis of organic nano-structured materials. LWM organo- and hydro-gels with oxalamide units represent construction units with high H-bonding potential; they are self-complementary, capable of unidirectional H-bonding suited for construction of self-assembled with fibrous morphology. In continuation of our previous research the attention will be focused on two main areas of research 1. nanofabrication; preparation of new materials by polymerization through cross linking the gel network or transcript to the TEOS and development of new organic materials that incorporate photoactive functional groups, and 2. bioinspired supramolecular systems for detection and degradation of fibrous supramolecular aggregates, such as Aß-protein and amyloid plaques (that are a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease) and vesicles functionalization for surface molecular recognition studies. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Supramolecular Chemistry, Self-Assembly, Gels, Hydrogels, Functional Materials, Nanomaterials, Molecular Surface Recognition, Complex Chemical Systems|

Long term Croatian economic policy and development stem from both short term policies and long term sustainability. By combining macroeconomic and development policies, the long term objectives of sustainability of natural resources, public sector economics, demographic changes, spatial economics and overall economic structure may be achieved. Thus, the goals of this research stem from the above stand point, and include: • Establish development policies for Croatia based on sustainable use of natural resources • Show how change of age structure in Croatia affects fiscal sustainability and short and long run economic development • Explore how three way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and movement of factors of production affect international, regional and urban development • Analyze structure of Croatian economy suitable for sustainable and deeper integration into the EU • Define integrative policies which lead to sustainable development of Croatian economy For achieving above mentioned goals, the project team is separated into four equally contributing groups and is structured as follows: 1. Sustainability of economic development within the context of scarce natural resources. 2. Sustainability of public sector economics and the labor market in the context of demographic changes in Croatia. 3. Sustainability of the degree of centralization in the context of spatial (international, urban and regional) economics. 4. Sustainability of current economic structure within the context of the EU integration Outcomes of the research will be innovative approach to controversy of long vs. short term development and stability, as well as integrative approach to different, and thus far, insufficiently interconnected fields of economic research. 					 				|	|Economy|	|sustainability, economic structure, resources, public sector economics, spatial economics|

Proposed project addresses the EU targets as defined by European Commission’s “Europe 2020” strategy for smart growth by focusing on research and development of highly-integrated and energy efficient optical transceivers and wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) components for next-generation of access and mobile backhaul networks using passive optical network (PON) infrastructure. The primary challenge, in wider adoption of WDM-PON, lies in the development of sufficiently low cost technology to be used at the users’ premises. Self-seeded WDM-PON has been actively investigated in recent years as potentially the lowest cost solution for next-generation access networks. The primary attraction of this architecture is its simplicity, lower power consumption, and cost advantage. Similar principles can be applied to multiplexing and interrogation systems for optical sensors and our aim is to develop, analyze and demonstrate sustainable all-optical infrastructure based on extended cavity resonators able to provide physical layer for both, access communication and sensor networks. At University of Zagreb we invented an optical component, the modulation-averaging reflector, which reduces the penalty due to modulation of the seeding light and depolarizes the light oscillating in the cavity thereby stabilizing the extended resonator. This was the first step towards a future-proof optical access technology. Within this project we will fully develop and characterize systems based on extended cavity resonators with modulation averaging reflectors. We will also explore the use of modulation averaging concept in a novel communication optical source architecture based on wavelength re-use. Finally, the concept of extended cavity resonators will also be implemented in non-communication applications such as new optical sensor schemes. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|optical access networks, WDM-PON, optical sensors, colorless optical transmitter, extended cavity, optical noise, noise reduction, wavelength re-use|

All these agricultural byproducts are abundant, cheap, non-food competing and renewable polysaccharide-based feedstocks. In this project, agricultural waste lignocellulosic raw materials will be hydrolyzed by thermal, chemical or enzymatic methods or their combinations in order to obtain adequate disintegration of raw materials. Studies of bioethanol and LA production will be performed by the semi-solid or solid state fermentation in the new constructed horizontal rotating tubular bioreactor (HRTB). The most suitable microorganisms for bioetahnol and LA production will be identified and improved by genetic methods. Studies regarding suitable purification methods for all three bio-products will be performed in order to obtain pure compounds for theirs further practical use. Integration between production and separation bioprocess stages will be also examined in order to improve ecological and economical aspects of these bioprocesses. The sustainability of bioethanol and LA production will be evaluated through the realization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The most efficient and sustainable bioprocess configuration will be determined and consequently scale-up procedure will be proposed.

One in three of the population develops cancer at some time in their lives and one in four dies from this disease. The main problems in antitumor chemotherapy are drug resistance and side effects on normal tissues. In the recent years a tremendous growth was witnessed in synthesis and development of vast number and types of new heterocyclic antitumor agents, with an emphasis on creation of new drugs with better selectivity or activity. The latter are indeed major requirements in development of novel anticancer drugs. The proposed scientific project is highly interdisciplinary and objective-oriented with the principal aim to develop the novel lead compounds with pronounced and selective anticancer activity that would be used for further phases of drug development. To achieve the principal aim following specific tasks are foreseen. The goal of the first one is to synthesize small-compound library (Classes A–H) comprising new conjugates of pseudopurines, coumarines and quinolines with 1,2,3-triazole scaffold, N-acyclic 5-unsaturated pyrimidine derivatives, amino-, amido- and amidino substituted benzimidazole, benzothiazole and benzo[b]thieno-2-carboxamide derivatives. Molecule library will be synthesized using modern synthetic approaches such as click chemistry, palladium mediated cross-coupling, eco-friendly microwave assisted and photochemical reactions as well as classical organic synthetic methods. The aim of the second task is to predict plausible biological targets and pharmacological activities using cheminformatics/in silico analysis.

The research starts with an extensive expert opinion survey about the state and perspectives of Croatian tax systems, which will be extended to Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to do relevant cross analysis of the obtained results. This survey will be followed by some public attitude surveys concerning relevant tax issues. The macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidation measures in Croatia, with the emphasis on tax measures, will be analyzed at different government levels as well as the effects of tax structure on the economic growth. The research will be broadened to encompass other (mostly region) countries. It is expected that the research team with their in-depth tax policy analyses will pinpoint different aspects of crucial tax policy issues in Croatia with problem-solving recommendations regarding financial transaction tax, real estate tax, environmental taxation, flat tax and some other base broadening and tax expenditure issues. 					 				|	|Economy|	|tax policy, tax system, tax structure, fiscal consolidation, Croatia|

Carob pods and juice has a very important role in diet of Mediterranean countries. Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) is also nutritionally and protectively very valuable plant overspread on the Mediterranean basin. The most important parts of the bay laurel plant are leaves which are used in traditional medicine, and in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Both species are also an important component of the Mediterranean vegetation and grows in marginal and prevailing calcareous soils. Since there is limited knowledge about Croatian populations of carob tree and bay laurel this studies will be conducted to determine morphological, genetic, phytochemical and ecological traits of Croatian populations of these species. Morphometric investigations will be made on leaves and fruits (carob tree) samples gathered in situ, while the genetic variability will be determined using AFLP analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the leaves. The content of polyphenolic compounds, antioxidant activity in vitro with the use of UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the share of macro and microelements using emission spectrometry (AES) will be determined in the leaves and fruits samples. Carob based soft drinks and pastry fillings will be developed as new products on Croatian market. Additionally, possible positive effects of addition supplement of carob tree in standard food for animals on health and production parameters in weaned pigs as the natural replacement of antibiotic growth promoters will be investigated. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|carob tree, Ceratonia siliqua L., bay laurel, Laurus nobilis L., biodiversity, utilization|

This is especially true regarding teachers’ emotional lives. The existing knowledge on teachers’ emotions indicates their influential potential on instructional practices, professional and personality development and well-being. By implication, emotions experienced by teachers in classroom settings and in relation to their professional activities, arise as a very important topic of research. Thus the main goal of this research proposal is to investigate the phenomena of teachers’ emotions and emotion regulation strategies as well as their personal and contextual antecedents and effects on various aspects of personal and professional functioning. In order to achieve this goal, the multimethod approaches will be implemented. More precisely, through the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, cross-sectional and longitudinal research designs, and individual and nomothetic approach, relations between teachers’ emotions and emotion regulation strategies, their personal (e.g. temperament, personality, beliefs, goals, cognitive appraisals) and contextual antecedents (factors from teachers’ school environment), as well as their effects on motivation (e.g. intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, goal orientations, self-efficacy), well-being (e.g. emotional labour, emotional exhaustion, burnout, mental health and intention to leave the profession) and relationships with students (e.g. different aspects of student-teacher interaction) will be explored on the samples of elementary-school teachers. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|Teachers, emotion, emotion regulation strategies, personal antecedents, contextual antecedents, motivation, well-being, relationship with students|

Any wireless device needs an antenna as the interface between the electronic circuits and the free space. Wireless communication modules, sensors and RFID devices are integrated in common objects like clothes, home appliances, toys, consumables, etc. The used antennas must be small and unobtrusive, yet energy efficient. The aim of this project is to investigate new materials and techniques for antenna fabrication including conductive textiles and threads. A textile antenna integrated into clothes must be lightweight, flexible, and comfortable to wear, but still must keep good radiation properties. Textile antennas are very interesting for military personnel on the field as well as for rescue teams. Another important application is healthcare, where wireless sensors in real time monitor the patients' health status and transmit data to the medical personnel. The broadest field of application of wearable antennas is in the entertainment and consumer electronics and mobile communications. Energy harvesting, and with it the associated antennas, can be used in all these fields to increase energy efficiency and enable operation of mobile devices. The aim of this project is to propose new and adapt existing antenna designs for integration into clothing and for new manufacturing techniques like embroidering or weaving. Another aspect to be considered in connection with wearable antennas is their operation in the proximity of human body which is a lossy dielectric. The second aim of this project is to study both theoretically and experimentally the propagation channel on the surface of the human body and off-body communications. The results will allow designing reliable on-body and off-body communication systems. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|antenna, textile antenna, wearable antenna, on-body communications, body-centric communications|

A significant part of this heritage is still not easily or reliably accessible to modern scholarship. Leveraging current European and international achievements and initiatives, our project will solve textual and editorial problems through scholarly collaboration, in that way providing grounds and opportunity for further interpretative insights about the life of the texts. The project will prepare and publish both printed and digital editions; editorial work of team members will be submitted to early collective peer review and discussion. The proposed framework will also serve as a training ground for next generations of textual scholars studying early modern Croatian literature; researchers of all career stages (including undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students) will be offered an opportunity to make their first contributions, also peer-reviewed and carefully attributed. Through these innovative procedures we aim to reinterpret scholarly edition as a fruitful and exciting interpretative undertaking, without which there can be no real understanding of our intellectual history. The main outcome of our project will be 15 scholarly editions published over four years: six texts of Croatian authors in Croatian (Mršić, Primović, Palmotić Dionorić, Divković, the Kajkavian miscellany of Nikola Šafran, M. Zlatarić), an edition of three Croatian woman writers in Italian (G. and S. Bona, M. Gondola Gozze), and eight texts of Croatian authors in Latin (Nikola Modruški, Marulić, Beneša, V.

In order to do that we have to study different forms of self-generating mechanisms by which the autonomous mind (AM) is brought about. The autonomous then stays roughly for the mental 'infrastructure' that operates by generating impulses for action, mental and motor, without having to process them in consciousness. We will consider this phenomenon as primary in relation to consciousness that emerges rather late in the chain of mental processing. One of the basic premisses that builds the ground for our investigation is the assumption that mental states are heavily underdetermined by sensory data. To claim this is to enter the dispute with the current mainstream (particularly within the consciousness studies) that sees mental phenomena (specifically consciousness) firmly rooted in sensation, on the ne hand; it also means a conflict with the canon of intellectualism, the long-lasting impact of which (following Descartes) resulted in consciousness- and thought-centeredness with which we are faced and which we want to critically examine, on the other hand. Representative of unconscious behavior is automaticity. Yet, whilst many authors affiliate this sort of action primarily with motor habits, we aim to extend the term far beyond bodily behavior and to include complex mental processes such as perception, memory, action, learning, and thought. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|intellectualism (a critique of), embodiment, autonomous mind, background, unconscious participation, skill, automaticity,|

Mislav Čavka|	|Warfare has afflicted humankind throughout its history, and is a phenomenon that still fundamentally affects the modern world. Despite the fact that violence -related mortality is profoundly undercounted, violent conflict represents the third most important source of mortality around the world. Analyzing the effects that war had on health through the deep time perspective that archaeological investigations afford can provide unique data on the interactions between warfare, health and the environment and provided conclusions that are particularly relevant to disadvantaged communities throughout the developing world where most wars are currently being fought. This project assembles an international and multidisciplinary team of collaborators to conduct bioarchaeological investigations on two large composite skeletal samples from Croatia. The two composite series represent individuals who inhabited Croatia throughout: a) the Late Medieval period (1100-1400 AD) a period of relative prosperity and peace prior to the arrival of Ottoman Turks, and b) individuals who inhabited Croatia in the Historic period (1400-1700 AD) during which time the Ottoman Empire gradually expanded into East and Central Europe. The research will reconstruct Historic period health, diet, weaning practices, and disease and trauma patterns by comparing them with data from the Late Medieval period using bioarchaeological, paleopathological and stable isotope analyses of human burials from Croatia. The project is a collaboration between researchers and postgraduate students who specialize in bioarchaeology, paleopathology, paleodemography, paleodontology, radiology and stable isotope analyses from four institutions: the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the School of Dental Medicine of the University of Zagreb, the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the University Hospital Dubrava, and the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research of the University of Cambridge. 					 				|	|Ethnology and anthropology|	|physical anthropology, bioarchaeology, paleopathology, health, war, osteological analyses, medieval period, Croatia|

In the first year of project we will explore the data collected by the CMS experiment during 2011 and 2012, while preparing for the LHC Run II, which is expected to start in 2015. Preparation consists of developing and implementing new electron reconstruction, identification and isolation algorithms, which will be used by the whole collaboration when the new data taking starts.

The starting point of the study is the Ottoman occupation of Bosnia in 1463 confirmed by defeat of Croatian army in the Battle of Krbava in 1493. The main allies of anti-Ottoman resistance Habsburgs, Venice and the popes sought to prevent the Ottoman penetration to the Adriatic and in the West. In their long term efforts they used tools of military revolution that has prevailed on their side. However, the early modern alliance is marked by a profound Habsburg-Venetian rivalry on the Adriatic which was ended by the fall of Venice in 1797 year. A new contender at the Adriatic, the revolutionary France, sought to repel Russians and Britons, and to provide a springboard to the East. After the fall of Napoleon, Austria secured supremacy on the sea, but the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Italy continued the centuries-long conflict over the Adriatic. In addressing the historical prospective, the project focuses on publishing five books which will present each phase of the competition and the main protagonists in this conflict. 1.

Its digestive property has been shown important in different pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and pathogen removal. Discoveries of specific autophagy receptors have opened a new chapter in the autophagy field. Of great interest is the removal of damaged or excess mitochondria through specialized autophagy- mitophagy. Together with colleagues, I have identified and characterized mitochondrial proteins Nix/Bnip3L and Bnip3 as a mitophagy receptors for recruiting the autophagic machinery to damaged mitochondria and help their elimination (Novak et al, 2010; Zhu et al, 2013). We demonstrated that receptors mediate mitochondrial clearance during reticulocyte differentiation. Our goal is to further study autophagy receptors and proteins associated with mitochondrial clearance to better understand the role of mitophagy and its mechanism. We will study: (1) phosphorylation and dimerization of receptors and the consequences of this events on mitophagy progression; (2)factors that regulate tight connection of apoptosis and mitophagy; (3)potential interplay between mitophagy receptors and other mitophagy-related proteins, like E3-ligase Parkin and kinase PINK1; (4)the effects of mitophagy on cancer development. To reach our goals we will use established methodology in our laboratories including protein identification and interaction techniques (Western blot, IP, GST-pull down, RNAi), immunofluorescent microscopy, mass spectrometry, ITC and NMR. All experiments will be performed using cultured cells. This project proposal has a high capacity to generate very interesting data with high possibility for publications in top scientific journals. Fundamentally, generated data will help to understand the physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cancer and allow us to manipulate mitophagy to fight diseases. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|autophagy, mitochondria, mitophagy, receptor, neurodegeneration, cancer|

Respective welfare value of these forests amount to 6,4 billion €, 2,8 billion € being attributed exclusively to ash forests. Growing stock in narrow-leafed ash forests reaches 4,3 million m3, binding 11,8 million tons of carbon dioxide acting as an important carbon sink depository. Natural and artificial regeneration of ash stands is under direct impact of numerous biotic and abiotic factors, many of which seriously hamper the viability of ash. Insect pests, pathogenic fungi, large game ungulates and ruminantes and small rodent populations play dominant role in the complex processes of tree decline and stand deterioration. Additionally, in the course of recent Europe-wide dramatic spread of newly identified lethal disease on ashes (Chalara fraxinea), introduction of a highly damaging Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) on the eastern borders of Europe, and increased frequency of climatic extremes urge the need to intensify the research of this phenomena. Through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, in the course of 4 years, the proposed research project targets on several critical aspects of aforementioned biotic detrimental factors analyzing them in the given area and time and aiming to provide a multitude of new details on the mechanisms of their impact. Modern methodological approach covers the following major research topics: presence, local impact and ash disease spread and host resistance tests; additive impact of ash defoliators in the course of recent decline and possibility to manage their populations via entomopathogenic organisms; the impact of small rodents on tree regeneration, acting also as an important human diseases reservoir; negative impact of large game in ash regeneration; geospatial and temporal analysis of major biotic influences in given forest communities. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|Fraxinus angustifolia, vitality, biotic agents, floodplain forests, modelling|

Namely, BCS offer direct assessment of the otherwise intangible factors such as economic agents’ perceptions and expectations. They measure the agents’ willingness to consume/invest/save, as opposed to their ability to do the same. Hence these psychological factors are crucial to understand the underlying market forces and agents’ behavior. The project goals are to: - Discern whether the non-rationality of consumers’ inflation expectations stems from the true inability of consumers to anticipate price changes, or did the researchers induce it themselves by falsely assuming that the distribution of BCS responses is normal. - Question whether the poor forecasting accuracy of BCS leading indicators can be improved through obtaining the optimal weights by (non)linear optimization. - Compose an optimism indicator based on BCS responses and determine the nature of its relationship with the stock market returns. Nonlinear time series analysis will be employed to test if the stock market reacts asymmetrically to positive/negative shocks in the economic sentiment. - Estimate the consumers’ willingness to buy realty and econometrically model its relationship with actual real estate prices. - Assess the value of BCS responses on households’ financial distress by correlating them to the common measures of poverty. - Employ the BCS data on managers’ perceptions to construct a liquidity indicator for the Croatian economy. The first 5 goals will be fulfilled by analyzing the proposed issues in EU countries, which will improve the general understanding of the role of sentiment in economic decision-making. Each of the stated research fields is expected to result in the publication of a paper in a reputable international journal. The results empirically obtained for Croatia will be synthesized in a scientific book at the end of the project. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Business and Consumer Surveys, economic sentiment, leading indicators, behavioral economics, nonlinear econometrics|

Several recent studies pointed to their role in the regulation of different cellular processes in eukaryotes, yet in many instances direct mechanistic roles remain elusive. Our recent study provided genetic, metabolic and biochemical evidence that synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates through activation of Plc1 and Kcs1 play an important role in the signalling response required for cell cycle progression after mating pheromone arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Banfic et al. J. Biol. Chem. 288: 1717-1725, 2013). However, it is still uncertain which of the pyrophosphates increased is/are responsible for Kcs1-mediated effects, and it is unclear what might be the possible link between the Kcs1-mediated increase in the level of pyrophosphates and the progression of yeast cells through the S phase of the cell cycle. This is a proposal that aims to define the mechanism of pyrophosphates-mediated regulation of cell cycle progression. We will use a set of yeasts deletion mutants to define a) the particular pyrophosphate responsible for S phase-associated effects, b) to test for the possibility that inositol pyrophosphates generated during S phase progression regulate telomere length, c) to test the possibility that the increase in the level of pyrophosphates in alpha-factor synchronized cells is associated with an increase in pyrophosphorylation of the proteins and/or protein expression or modification, and d) to determine the changes in metabolism in alpha-factor synchronized cells and to correlate them with the changes in the level of inositol pyrophosphates. Overall, this proposal seeks to elucidate lipid-derived inositol phosphate signal transduction pathways in the regulation of cell cycle and metabolism. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|inositol phosphates, inositol pyrophosphates, cell cycle, matabolism, protein pyrophosphorylation|

We believe that the changes of structure and expression of the selected genes correlate with the phenotypic changes of tumor cells. EMT is a process very much involved in invasion and progression of tumors. Many oncogenic signaling pathways can induce EMT. The classical Wnt pathway has a particularly tight link with EMT and it has been shown that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin can induce EMT. Wnt pathway is one of the basic cellular pathways whose misregulation plays important roles in tumorigenesis and whose mediators of transcription are members of TCF/LEF family. Another important protein family is the Dishevelled considered to be the central hub of Wnt signaling since it interacts with Wnt receptors and recruits the multiprotein beta-catenin destruction complex. The experiments of the proposed research will use modern methods of molecular biology for the analyses of brain tumor samples of different malignancy grades. The genetic changes will be tracked by PCR/loss of heterozygosity, heteroduplex and Spreadex electorphoresis (Elchrom Scientific, Switzerland) methods. Expression of selected proteins will be studied by immunohistochemistry demonstrating their location in tumor cells. Besides its scientific value, results from the proposed project will have an application in medical diagnostics. Identifying changes in molecules responsible for control of cell motility will give us the preconditions for understanding the invasiveness of brain tumors and offer new disease progression markers. Our experimental evidence would also encourage the development of therapies that specifically interfere with Wnt signaling in cancer. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Wnt signaling, EMT, brain tumors, invasion, dishevelled, TCF/LEF|

S and C cycles in the aqueous environment are recognized as important factors for regulating global climate. Nowadays, human activities have vastly affected the S and C cycles. The aquatic ecosystem responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economic forcing induced by global climate changes, including warming, acidification, biodiversity modifications as well changes in frequency of extreme events (flooding, dust input, hypoxia-anoxia appearance) and by growing anthropogenic pressures will be considered under SPHERE. Effects of the main natural and anthropogenic forcing (extreme events, eutrophication, global changes) related with S and C dynamics will be studied. The SPHERE objectives are: 1) testing and improving existing methods and development of new methods essential for S and organic matter (OM) characterization in water and atmospheric environment; 2) to estimate exchanges and interactions of S and C with other natural and potentially toxic trace elements within and between the major environmental compartments; 3) to monitor and couple S and C dynamics under extreme events (stratification-destratification, hypoxia-anoxia, extreme atmospheric inputs); 4) to synthesize all obtained data for assessment of ecosystem vulnerability and ecological status, in line with water framework directive and national strategy. The SPHERE will be implemented in the period of 4 years through 5 workpackages: 1) OM properties and dynamics; 2) S speciation and dynamic; 3) S, C interaction with trace metals and importance of chalcogenide nanoparticles; 4) thermodynamic predictions for S and C distribution and dynamics; 5) project management. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|sulphur speciation, organic matter properties, nanoparticles in water environment, aerosols, global climate changes, extreme events, euxinia|

Cyrill and Methodius), and under heavy influence of the medieval Croatian vernacular. Being referential and representative, the corpus of the CCS texts provides the most effective basis available for the relevant research of the CCS. The project includes theoretical and applied linguistic research. Among the applied linguistic disciplines, two lexicographic tasks play focal roles: compiling of Rječnik crkvenoslavenskoga jezika hrvatske redakcije (Eng. Dictionary of the Croatian Redaction of Church Slavonic; DCRCS) and conversion of the CCS corpus into digitally readable text(s). Theoretical and other, non-lexicographical, applied linguistic research include those within the fields of: semantics (esp. of the lexis expressing feelings/passions), theory and practice of (medieval) translation (direct translation from Latin into CCS, and inherited OCS translations of the Greek texts within the CCS tradition), grammar (primarily syntax of negation, agreement, infinitive, CCS psalter), textology (selected CCS texts, CCS psalter). Substantial contribution of the project research cover (inter)national fields of: (paleo)slavistic and medieval studies, historical lexicography, diachronic study of the Croatian language diasystem, interdisciplinary investigation of the history of emotions. Finally, through the CCS corpus management (i.e. conversion of the CCS corpus into digitally readable format) and the DCRCS compiling, the project offers irreplaceable and permanent assistance to any scholarly or scientific field interested in the CCS texts contents. Due to the range of texts incorporated into the corpus, this contribution is virtually unforseeable. 					 				|	|Philology|	|Croatian Church Slavonic, (paleo)slavistic studies, (historical) lexicography, Medieval studies, linguistics|

Adopting a broad perspective it will take into account most diverse aspects of identity, such as social, political, religious, ethnic, or individual, as well as their interactions. This requires investigation of diverse historical sources which range from texts (e.g. historiography, diplomatic correspondence, notary records), to social practices (e.g. ritual) or urban topography and visual arts. Besides such comprehensiveness, another important novelty of the project is its chronological scope. It takes into account long period of almost half a millennium, thereby disregarding the conventional divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, which will enable valuable insights into long term (dis)continuities. Yet another important novelty is that the project focuses on a premodern city-state, a type of community relatively neglected in the field of identity studies mostly focused on modern period and national states. Finally, the project will also adopt a strongly comparative perspective, investigating the (dis)similarities between Dubrovnik and other Mediterranean cities. Since the enterprise of this scope necessarily involves specialists in different fields and methodologies, the project assembles an interdisciplinary team led by the Academician Nenad Vekarić. It consists of ten scientists, two postdoctoral researchers and four doctoral students. The project proposes to publish more than 10 scientific books, numerous articles, and organize four workshops. Besides offering the answer to an important scientific problem, the main objective of the project is to present to the international audiences the less known but important case of Dubrovnik, thus contributing to the visibility and networks of Croatian scholars. 					 				|	|History|	|Dubrovnik, Identity, Middle Ages, Early Modern Period, cultural history|

The link between the two is poorly understood. There is growing evidence that OSAS contributes to the initiation and progression of hypertension, heart failure, cardiac ischemia, stroke and cognitive decline. Chronic sympathetic activation resulting in elevated sympathetic nerve activity and cardio-respiratory sensitivity to hypoxia appears to be important. Still, the exact mechanisms underlying the link between OSA and cardiovascular and neurophysiologic disturbances are not completely known. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) in experimental animals can mimic periods of repeated apneas seen in OSAS patients. Exposure to repeated bouts of hypoxia in human leads to increased sympathetic activity, whilst intermittent hypoxia in experimental animals evokes increases in phrenic and sympathetic nerve activities. The proposed study will examine the role of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (e.g. serotonin and opioids) in evoking sympathetic long-term facilitation using anesthetized animal model of IH. The only way to understand complex pathophysiological interactions in OSAS patients is to use translational and multidisciplinary approach, as proposed in this project. Our focus in the human studies is to study neurophysiologic (brain motor control, control of breathing, neurographic features of peripheral nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity) function in OSAS patients and the links to metabolic, stress, and cognitive parameters. Preliminary data from pilot studies suggest it is possible to achieve the new findings using this novel approach. We will also study longitudinal therapeutic effects of the gold standard therapy in OSAS such as the overnight use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices in Split Sleep Cohort of patients, which we plan to form during the work on this project. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|intermittent hypoxia, phrenic long term facilitation, respiratory neuroplasticity, sleep apnea, neurophysiology, polysomnography|

The primary issue addressed in the field of HTSC is the existence of electron pockets in low magnetic fields caused by charge density waves, CDW, in pure YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals. We propose to measure the magnetisation and specific heat in the whole doping range to extract the total density of states at the Fermi level and thereby determine the number of pockets. At the same time we will look for thermodynamic signatures of the CDW phase transitions. Other unresolved controversies which will be investigated include the doping evolution of the mean-field upper critical field and whether Gaussian superconducting fluctuations can account for the magnetisation and specific heat of both underdoped and overdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals at T&gt;Tc. In the field of TI, we will investigate the thermoelectric properties of bismuth based chalcogenide (BiSbTeSe2) and 3D Dirac semimetals and to find the evidence of the linear dispersion and nontrivial topology of these materials. Our next aim is to achieve ferromagnetism in selected TIs; TlBi(S0.5Se0.5)2, PbSnTe and PbSnSe by doping with Mn or Fe and gain understanding of the mechanism responsible for the ferromagnetic ordering. In the field of MG and NCA the goal is to gain some insight into the glassy structure and mechanism involved in its crystallisation. In the field of organic conductors we intend to investigate PANI-DBSA (DBSA-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid) thin film samples. A particular emphasis of the research will be the further development of novel apparatus to measure the magnetisation and specific heat of small single crystals which are often of the highest quality. 					 				|	|Physics|	|Superconductivity, topological insulators, metallic glasses, nanocrystalline alloys, conducting polymers,|

Numerous studies, including those from our laboratory have established that the injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is the important site for pathophysiologic changes that lead to development of neuropathic pain. Although DRG neurons are critical for the onset of neuropathic pain, there are no relevant clinical treatments for neuropathic pain that target this organ. With this proposal we aim to prove that neurostimulation techniques can be successfully used to manipulate neuronal function at the level of experimentally injured DRGs. In order to test this hypothesis we will construct a fully implantable neuronal stimulator for freely moving rats, devise an implantation technique and define stimulation protocols. This stimulator will be tested in rats with two types of experimentally induced nerve injury; spinal nerve ligation and carrageenan-induced inflammation model. Since this invasive procedure bears substantial risk of inflammation and other adverse neural tissue response, which can induce pain per se, we will also investigate connective tissue fibrosis and neuroinflammatory response in neural tissue of DRG and dorsal horn. The effect of the stimulation on excitability of injured DRG neurons will also be tested in vitro. Our last aim builds on our previous study in which we showed that neuronal injury may disable T-junction filtering and thereby increase the net conduction of afferent traffic. With this proposal we will test whether stimulation can modulate filtering properties of DRG T-junction. This will be addressed using recordings from injured sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia excised from adult rats, and recently developed methodology that will allow us to electrically visualize action potential propagation in DRG neurons grown over custom microelectrode arrays. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|neuropathic pain, nerve injury, neuromodulation, dorsal root ganglion, ganglionic field stimulation, T-junction, microelectrode arrays|

Its unique hydration structure enables it to interact with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules which probably contribute to the multifunctional character of trehalose. The major applications of trehalose have been in science, medicine and cosmetic sectors due to its natural functionality, mechanism of action and technical qualities. The limiting factor of trehalose use in the food industry used to be the ingredient cost but with development of a new manufacturing process, the cost of trehalose production has been dramatically reduced. It is about 45% as sweet as sucrose and very stable under processing and storage conditions. Texture, colour and aroma are the main quality attributes influencing consumer acceptability of fruit products. During formulation of fruit products different additives are often used to obtain desired properties of semi-products or final products. The aim of this project is investigation of the influence of trehalose on fruit product quality with emphasis on the explanation of trehalose mechanism of action in complex fruit product matrices. Practical application of project results would be valuable for new food product development. Through addition of trehalose to fruit product the retention of key aroma compounds, and prevention of colour degradation could be achieved, ensuring in this way more fresh-like characteristics of the final product. Also, through retention of phenols, especially pigments, such as anthocyanins, which are known for their antioxidant properties, obtained products would have higher nutritional value, as well as organoleptic properties. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|trehalose, fruit products, colour, aroma, texture, trehalose action|

The materials' parameters in existing US systems used in biomedicine and industry are determined at low excitation levels assuming linear physical principles and consistent thermodynamical conditions. This is different from real operating conditions where range of applied powers and types of excitation signals is various and very often far away from linear. The neglect of these nonlinearities in active and passive materials, used in the complete US system construction process, leads to the problem of the US systems’ efficiency factor in the nonlinear driving conditions. The construction of modular measurement system with included and modified interferometry and time of flight principle with added new measurement procedure is crucial for developing novel US systems with higher electroacoustic efficiency factors. The new method is based on tracking the resonant frequency changes of the nonlinear electro-mechanical-acoustical system for determination complex material parameters. The new modular measurement system will enable exposure of materials to the US fields with various driving conditions. Tracking the resonant frequency changes of excitated loading medium sample (active piezoceramic or passive construction elements or different types of loading mediums) is novel method for determination of material parameters when nonlinear effects appear in the loading mediums. As a result of more precise constructive material parameters determination, three prototypes of US systems with probes and electronic excitation circuits for applications in biomedicine and industry, with obtained higher electroacoustic efficiency factors will be developed, constructed and tested during this project. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|material parameters, ultrasound, modular measurement system, nonlinear effects, effciency factor|

Identify potentially detrimental mutations and to estimate detrimental load in all analysed populations; 3.) develop computerised approach (set of algorithms) that will, in terms of probability or likelihood, enable imputation of sequenced mtWGS haplotypes for other pedigree members as well as to point to animals that are wrongly assigned to the pedigree, 4.) Identify mutations that are associated with phenotypic variability of milk production and fertility traits and to estimate the magnitude of the mtWGS effects (haplotypes) in terms of variance components and 5.) Identify private (specific) mutations that can be used in traceability or genetic bar-coding of species and breeds (this is of particular interest for endangered populations). In performing these comprehensive analyses we will use newly developed methodologies of high-throughput sequencing and complex computing analyses. We believe that this research will stimulate other researchers involved in animal genetics and breeding of other species (dog, horse, swine, rabbit, etc…) for similar researches. Furthermore, results of the project will be economically utilised in cattle breeding as well as conservation management of endangered Croatian breeds. At the same time, we hope that innovative and technologically advanced component of this research will result in good publication record for all scientists involved which will further increase our competitiveness to approach to EU funded projects. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|Whole mitogenome, Cattle, Detrimental effects, Phenotypic variability, Quantitative genetics|

Daria Kveštak|	|The infection of mice with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as a model of human CMV (HCMV) infection has been particularly informative in elucidating the role of antiviral immune response. NK cells are essential in early control of CMV infection. An evolutionary struggle between NK cells and CMVs can be inferred from a numerous viral mechanisms designed to compromise NK cell function. A deeper insight was gained by studying MCMV evasion of ‘missing-self’ mechanisms and host response to this immunoevasion, illustrated by several MCMV-specific NK cell activating receptors. The work on Ly49H receptor emphasized the selective pressure imposed on the virus to generate variants no longer recognized by this receptor. Another example can be seen from the function of viral m04 protein, which binds to newly synthesized MHC-I molecules and escorts them to the cell surface to engage inhibitory Ly49 receptors. However, while m04 prevents NK cell activation by escaping ‘missing-self’ recognition, several activating Ly49 receptors also depend on its presence for their own recognition of infected cells. Beside m04, another so far unidentified viral factor is required for turning on the activating Ly49 receptors. In addition to characterization of this new viral gene, the aim of this study is to elucidate the functional significance of MCMV-specific activating Ly49 receptors and their interaction with inhibitory counterparts during primary and latent infection. Ly49 receptors in mice are functional homologues of KIR receptors in humans. Recent studies also indicate a strong impact of HCMV on the repertoire and frequency of activating KIR-expressing NK cells, suggesting their specific response to this virus. Therefore, in addition to the MCMV genes involved in ligation of activating Ly49 receptors, here we also propose study aimed to characterize HCMV gene(s) involved in ligation of activating KIRs. We expect these studies to provide new data of groundbreaking potential in the field. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|NK cells, cytomegalovirus, immunoevasion, Ly49 receptors, KIR receptors, transcriptomics|

For most people the adolescence is the tipping point for career decision making. Last grade high-school students have to decide between further education on universities or entering the world of work and finding a job. To successfully overcome this important career transition period, adolescents have to become aware of their preferences and capabilities, to crystallize their career goals and to form their vocational identity. By implementing their vocational identity through engagement in their desired job or educational program, they should be able to achieve success and satisfactions in their careers, to fit in and adjust to their working environment and job demands, and to be motivated for their work and future advancement. The Adolescent Career Transition Model encompasses several career related behaviours, competences and traits that can influence positive career transition outcomes. We will assess approximately 1200 high school students at the beginning of the last grade of high-school (17-18 years) and follow their career development for the next 18 months. In three separate time points we will administer measures of career-related traits and social support, career self-guidance competencies, vocational development and career transition outcomes, through a secure online testing system that will be developed for this project. Statistical data analysis of the obtained data will be performed by adequate multivariate models to answer specific research objectives. Once the postulation and evaluation of the ACTM and the dissemination of the results are completed, the aim of the project is to create a new online career guidance system on the basis of the results of our research. This new online guidance system will be open and free for public use, and remain as a valuable and practically usefully legacy of the project. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|career transition, adolescence, career maturity, career identity, career decision making|

The importance of accurate volatility estimates has become even more significant after the financial crisis. As volatility itself is not observable variable, many different volatility estimators have emerged in the literature to address this problem. This project proposal will explore some of methodologically complexities of volatility modelling and forecasting with respect to both the parametric and nonparametric approaches. Moreover, one of the objectives is to investigate news impact curve of different volatility models as well as to compare different types of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedascity models in terms of their ability to describe structural changes in returns and to explore if Markov regime switching GARCH models outperform uni-regime GARCH models in forecasting volatility when sudden switching occurs. According to previous commonly used aspects of volatility measurement and modelling, two relatively new approaches will be explored. First one relies on neural-networks as econometric tool. The second one combines panel methodology with GARCH models. It should be emphasized that new OHLC volatility estimator will be defined as the most efficient one when high frequency data is not available. The main contribution is to train doctoral and postdoctoral students within interdisciplinary areas of statistics, econometrics, financial econometrics, mathematics, operational research and their applications. 					 				|	|Economy|	|OHLC volatility estimator, GARCH switching model, news impact curve, panel-GARCH models, high-frequency data, neural-networks, quasi-Newton algorithm|

This project will investigate a possibility to design and operate a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell with ambient air without external humidification using water and heat produced inside the fuel cell. This may be accomplished with adequate temperature distribution along the cathode channel, which would require a specific design of the fuel cell in terms of spatially variable heat transfer rates, and corresponding control of the cooling subsystem. In order to determine whether the proposed concept would result in longer life of fuel cell, some basic understanding of causes of fuel cell degradation is needed, particularly related to water and heat management. Particularly, it is proposed to investigate heat transfer in nano-structured catalyst layer because inadequate heat removal from the electrochemical reaction sites may be one of the causes for fuel cell degradation. Other stressors will be studied as well, and procedures for accelerated durability testing will be established, in order to confirm that the proposed concept of water and heat management is beneficial to fuel cell durability. The proposed research is expected to improve understanding of water and heat transfer in PEM fuel cell, including the effects that dry conditions and inadequate heat removal from the catalyst sites may have on fuel cell durability. This novel concept of variable temperature along the cathode channel would result in simplification of the fuel cell support system by eliminating the devices needed for external humidification, without affecting fuel cell performance and durability in various applications. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|PEM fuel cell, temperature control, humidity of reactant gases, durability stressors, decay mechanisms|

Marko Vrdoljak|	|Weak convergences are the foundation of most successful methods in the investigation of partial differential equations today. The approach known as Tartar's programme proved particularly convenient for partial differential equations modelling physical laws; the basic assumption being that weak convergences of sequences of solutions model the transition from microscale to macroscale. Of importance are also mathematical objects being, in a generalised sense, accumulation points of weakly convergent sequences, such as defect measures or H-measures. The research will be directed towards improving the existing weak convergence methods, designing new mathematical objects for that purpose, as well as developing new methods, with particular attention paid to their applications to practical problems. Problems known as homogenisation are tied to properties of mixtures of materials, with important applications in optimal design. Problems related to evolutionary equations and their admissibility conditions mainly concern transport problems in free and porous media, where it is sometimes natural to include continuous time random walk variables in the model. Such problems sometimes also lead to fractional derivative equations. Some problems are related to hyperbolic conservation laws and the propagation and interaction of singularities. High-frequency waves corresponding to solutions of hyperbolic systems are governed by ODEs, allowing for final interpretation as particles. Particularly interesting are situations where the equation changes its type (like transonic fluid flow), motivating our interest in Friedrichs systems. Further results for semilinear systems could open a new approach to the Maxwell-Dirac system, with potential applications in quantum field theory. Practical computation of coefficients in specific applications is also important; as the unknown functions have the domain in multidimensional space, quite often more efficient numerical methods have to be developed. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|weak convergences, partial differential equation, homogenisation, optimal design, H-measures, semiclassical measures, transport problems|

Daniela Maric Pfannkuchen,(dr. sc.) Jakica Njire|	|The northern Adriatic (NA) seems to be strongly influenced by the anthropogenic drivers - climatic changes, acidification and eutrophication. Its semi-enclosed nature, characterised by smaller inertia - due to the relative short residence time of its water masses, makes it highly reactive to the external forcing, in particular to the variations of the water, energy and matter fluxes at the interfaces. The NA, identified as a Mediterranean's climatic change „hotspot“, is expected to withstand environmental impacts that are considerably greater than in many other places worldwide. Such a uniquely dynamic system allows as to investigate the biological capacity and ecosystem elasticity in relation to these forcings. This project, at this state of knowledge, will be the first one that tries addressing the impact of the aforementioned anthropogenic drivers on the ecosystem behaviour (changes in water chemistry, metabolic activity and biodiversity). It will also advance the international state of the art in the following aspects: temporal resolution of the in situ acidification and phytoplankton physiology analysis, taxonomic resolution, combined taxonomic and metabolic analyses and molecular biodiversity. A buoy positioned at a point that integrates the most of the NA dynamics will serve as a hub for the continuous acquisition of the oceanographic and biological parameters. Together with the largest historical data set in the wider area and the most advanced approaches (in situ pH and phytoplankton physiology, taxonomy and analyses of metabolic activities), it will allow us an exhaustive insight in these interactions. At the end, this research will enable us to build scenarios of possible ecosystem reactions to predicted environmental changes in the NA and, in a wider sense, to all marine systems. 					 				|	|Biology|	|northern Adriatic, climatic changes, acidification, biodiversity, eutrophication|
