We start from the observation that the scholarly discourses in Croatia have so far not sufficiently acknowledged the cultural complexity of the economic sphere, especially the seminal significance of histories of Britain and America in that regard. Our methodological point of departure is therefore the assertion that the economic sphere can be understood only in reference to the entirety of culture. We intend to explore the complexity of this totality as refracted through cultural histories of Britain and America, as a horizon necessary for understanding Croatian cultural history. Our intent is to investigate complex interrelations of the sophisticated Victorian variant of capitalism and its American mutations, in the 19th and the 20th centuries. This applies primarily to Cold-War America, when capitalism contrasted to socialism becomes a totalizing formula to regulate various economic and political structures, but also the sphere of culture where public vs private is defined. Thus caught in relation to socialism, capitalism is definitive to life in the former Yugoslavia as well; this then sediments into a difficult genealogy which burdens capitalism when, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it enters formerly socialist countries, now as a platform for understanding and regulating postsocialism. Our approach is anchored in the assumption that research based only in economy or political theory fails to shed light on the logic of capitalism. This defines our methodology: we maintain that a truly functional analysis of the impact of capitalism demands a confluence of literary history, film studies, psychoanalysis, philosophy, cultural theory and, especially, the knowledge specific to English and American Studies. 					 				|	|Philology|	|cultural history, economy, capitalism, Britain, America, Croatia|

It will enable numerous physicians to acquire the trunk surface (TS). TS symmetry is one of the key elements in diagnostic and evaluation of various treatments in patients with trunk deformities. Common radiographic evaluation methods are known to expose patients to a radiation and, besides, radiography is actually 2D representation of 3D problem which has been shown not to be directly related to the shape of the back. Thus, there has been a constant motivation among researchers at (inter)national level to develop an optimal methodology for 3D reconstruction of the back. Still, most of those developed systems are mainly directed to 3D reconstruction of the spine and calculation of the Cobb angle which is still regarded by many as the gold standard method to measure scoliotic deformity. Still, the Cobb angle alone cannot explain the whole of the surface deformity. Evidently, there is high need to investigate development of a 3D reconstruction system which will capture both back and front of the patient, i.e. the entire trunk surface. In turn it would enable a more thorough analysis of the patient’s deformity pattern, i.e. a second major goal during this project is to derive other parameters (not only Cobb angle) in order to quantify trunk deformities. In designing 3D system we underline that we plan to research the implementation of both passive and active stereovision strategies. Researching the implementation of combined best features from passive and active stereo for one concrete of 3D system aimed at TS reconstruction (scoliosis), would be a great contribution for potential other 3D applications. Degenerative diseases of spine represent a serious social problem in Croatia. More than 10% of population has frequent problems with it. Clearly, every research contribution for this matter would be an extremely valuable asset. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|3D reconstruction, structured light, passive stereo, scoliosis, degenerative disease, 3D spine shape|

The main goal of the research is to propose a model of measuring the efficiency of public health services that can also be applied to other activities in healthcare and other public services such as local government, universities etc. The model will be based on the combination of two methods (DEA and BSC) that are suitable for measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of various public services. DEA method is traditionally used for non profit organizations where similar units operate with different input/output basically without any income. BSC is a method that encourages strategic thinking and evaluates the effectiveness of set goals. The combination of DEA and BSC is relatively a new approach and is used to identify the cause and effect relationships especially within inefficient units. The model will be developed for the Teaching Institute of the Public Health of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County which has 48 organization units (DMUs). The objective of the project proposals are as follows: to determine relative efficiency of each organization unit and suggest improvements for the inefficient ones (projection on the efficient frontier-DEA method), to define an integrative model (integration of DEA and BSC) for measuring the efficiency of individual perspectives within BSC framework with the aim to assess the effectiveness of achieving goals. 					 				|	|Economy|	|public health services, efficiency, measurement, DEA, BSC|

The defining characteristics of CSC are self-renewal, propagation into heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells, and increased resistance to chemotherapy, thus, attacking the CSC should abolish a tumor's ability to recur or metastasize. Recently, a natural potassium ionophore salinomycin was identified as one of a few available CSC-selective substances, but the precise mechanism of its selectivity remains elusive. Based on hypothesis that the potassium transport is an important process of CSC biology, the objective of the proposed research is to understand fundamental processes of CSC-resistance to therapy and to discover novel compounds with ion homeostasis-modulating properties to selectively target CSC. Project methodology orchestrates research in three principle areas and their close interactions, covering synthesis and characterization of molecules (chemistry), assessment of their activity in biological models (biology, medicine) and computer-aided drug design (computational sciences). We’ll focus on salinomycin and a series of proprietary crown ether compounds, which will be optimized and developed. Their efficacy/selectivity and influence on drug transporters P-gp- and/or ABCG2-mediated efflux of chemoterapeutics will be assessed, as well as the toxicity and in vivo activity of the most promising compound. Deploying cutting-edge techniques in cell and molecular biology, bioimaging, molecular electrophysiology and transgenic cell lines (e.g. a unique CSC model - HMLEshEcad cells) we will strive to recognize novel biomarkers for identification and enrichment of CSC, related to abnormal potassium transport regulation that promote acquisition of CSC phenotype and/or influence their proliferation, death and migratory potential. The ultimate aim is to translate this knowledge into innovative mechanism-based therapeutic approaches. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|cancer stem cells, potassium transport, salinomycin, crown ethers, ion channels, ABC transporters, predictive QSAR modeling, drug discovery, therapy|

Robot’s performances during the surgical procedures are investigated within the previously conducted technological project, RONNA - Robotic Neurosurgical Navigation. Results of RONNA suggest that the benefits of using robots in the operating room are enormous, e.g. increased accuracy and repeatability of the surgical procedures, flexible and tremor free operations, etc. During the RONNA realisation, it is recognized that certain new cognitive robot skills yet need to be developed. The long-term vision of the proposed ACRON project as a multi-disciplinary research arises from the recognition that a paradigm shift in human-robot-environment interaction is needed. Currently, technology robustness is achieved by restricting the interaction space, so that the region and the nature of the interaction can be controlled by the system. In ACRON, the cognitive fulcrum will therefore move from sensed data to the robot contextual anticipation. ACRON will advance the research providing a uniform scientific framework for the study, development and implementation of cognitive concepts, providing the robot to function in ICT enabled ubiquitous environment that can be shared by different kinds of agents. ACRON will therefore bring the new context-aware medical robot capable to anticipate the most appropriate actions respecting the phase of the medical procedure and spatial positions of the staff and objects. We will investigate the relationship between people, robots and the shared environment where they interact and work together. By moving throughout the discretized working space and while achieving the current assignment, the medical robot will become able to avoid all-possible spatial collisions and make the appropriate context-based decisions. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|robotics, artificial intelligence, cognitive models, medicine, neuroscience|

We are talking about 42 poets. This project is thus a survey of everything that was written in the 17th century, in all three literary forms (Lyric, Narrative and Drama), excluding the writers that already have their own critical editions (Palmotić, Gleđević, Gundulić, Đurđević, Bunić). The project is substantial since it encompasses: a) collecting and comparison of manuscripts; b) transcribing the manuscripts; c) an accompanying study.

This project deals with development of an integrated software system that includes general and domain specific time series features, with application in biomedicine. The goal of the project is to develop an efficient and upgradeable system for automatic classification of human body disorders based on the analysis of multiple heterogeneous biomedical signals (heart rhythm, ECG, EEG, etc.). In addition to classification, the project will also pursue visualization of disorders using computer graphics. Calculation speed will be increased using multicore parallelization. The system will contain subsystems for: 1) selection, display, and pre-processing of multiple signals from input records, 2) parallel analysis and extraction of multiple domain specific and general signal features, 3) visualization of signals and disorders using computer graphics, and 4) automatic construction and evaluation of the models. For evaluation purposes, the project will use referential biomedical signal databases from the PhysioNet portal and, if possible, anonymous records from local hospitals. One of the contributions of the system will be development of an expert subsystem for automatic recommendation of the set of features that should be extracted. The implemented general signal features will include relevant nonlinear dynamics measures. Specialized, domain specific features will be implemented for each type of biomedical signal individually. When constructing disorder models, feature space dimensionality reduction will be pursued. Disorders will be modeled based on clear description machine learning algorithms such as classification rules as well as maximum accuracy algorithms such as decision tree ensembles. Within the scope of this interdisciplinary project, several contributions in the areas of computer science, biomedical engineering, and medicine are expected. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|time series, biomedical signal processing, nonlinear dynamics, expert system, classification model, artificial intelligence|

Research results indicate the increased scope of workload and demands for new approaches to teaching, disharmony between teaching and research, increasing administrative duties, and the insistence on a stronger connection between the academic community and social environment. This project aims to determine how academics in Croatia assess the relevance of various competences, and how they assess, perceive and interpret possession of various competences that shape contemporary academic profession. It is expected that the research results in a proposal of the academic profession’ competence framework. In the research quantitative and qualitative methodological approach (survey and semi-structured interview) will be used. The survey consists of the competence framework elements which are to be evaluated by the participants in terms of the assessment of their (1) relevance and (2) possession. The interviews will explore the deeper perception of academics and challenging issues within the framework, and gain a ‘holistic’ (comprehensive, systemic, integrated) understanding of context, while capturing data on the participants perceptions ‘from the inside’. The final definition of an integrated competence framework which includes different dimensions of the academic profession is an original research contribution. Bearing in mind that the research of the academic profession is neglected in the national research discourse, the results of this study will also be a starting point for defining recommendations for (national) educational policies. This will particularly apply to profiling the academic profession in the context of recent strategic directions in Croatia, in accordance with the requirements of the international scientific community. 					 				|	|Pedagogy|	|higher education, academic profession, competence framework, academic roles, higher education policy|

This issue will be tackled at different biological levels, from subcellular to organism, thus establishing how different levels of biological organisation cope with metal exposure. Multielemental analytical technique will be applied to analyse metals/metalloids in water and biota samples and the suit of biomarkers will be studied on selected aquatic organisms encompassing biomarkers of general stress and biomarkers of metal exposure and effect. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), as a new, state-of-the-art technique, will be applied for cellular metal imaging in order to measure, visualize and quantify the distribution of specific metals at the sub-cellular level in biological materials. The application of NanoSIMS in the proposed project will for the first time enable the insight into the circulation of metals within tissues and cells of aquatic organisms living under increased metal exposure. The resulting information of the proposed project will generally contribute to better understanding of metal processes in cells and tissues and consequences of metal exposure in aquatic organisms. Additional aim of the project is to evaluate anthropogenic impact on selected freshwater ecosystems (rivers Krka, Ilova) referring to metal/metalloid pollution and using integrated chemical, biochemical and biological approach, as well as to evaluate the risk for human health. In addition, it will contribute to development of water management plans and is therefore, of strategic importance for the Republic of Croatia.

Among these, the few serendipitously discovered examples of crystals that suddenly jump while heated, to distances several thousand times larger than their own dimension in less than 1 ms, provide the most impressive display of the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical work. These thermosalient crystals are biomimetic, nonpolymeric self-actuators par excellence. Yet, due to exclusivity of the phenomenon, but also due to the complexity of analytical methods for its characterization, reasons behind this colossal self-actuation remain unexplained. Within this project, reasons behind the thermosalient effect in chosen systems of organic molecular crystals (trans,trans,anti,trans,trans perhydropyrene, L-pyroglutamic acid and N'-2-propylidene-4-hydroxy-benzohydrazide), already reported in the literature – but unexplained, will be revealed. Furthermore, research will broaden to include a group of compounds obtained by careful and planned modification of the compounds in which the effect has already been observed. It is to be expected that the thermosalient effect is very sensitive to the subtle changes in the chemical composition so this will enable determination of necessary chemical/structural parameters so as to arouse the thermosalient effect in the system. With the aim of final elucidation of the thermosalient phenomenon, this project represents first systematic attempt to disentangle the interplay between the thermodynamic, kinematic, structural and macroscopic factors that drive the thermosalient effect by employing various diffraction (XRD), microscopic (hot stage), spectroscopic, (FTIR, UV/VIS) and thermal (DTA/DSC/TG) techniques.

The initial shape iteration will start from 3D point clouds, possibly resulting from shape digitization (existing high-resolution optical scanning system). Mathematical parameterization of the point clouds will be based on parametric surfaces. Integral as well as chained piecewise surfaces will be explored and compared. Dynamic aspects of the parameterizations will be studied. The shape and possibly topology of the object will be changing in simulation/ optimization quasi-time iterations. During the process, edges and peaks may disappear and new ones may arise, whereby the parameterization must be autonomously adaptable to such changes. Strategies for controlled reductions of the parameterization data-sets based on permissible threshold values for peak error and cumulative error norms will also be studied. These strategies will include adaptive re-allocation of the control points using feature recognition procedures (edges, peaks) based on eigenvalue ratios and slope and curvature estimators. Adaptive partitioning of the overall object surface based on different criteria will be evaluated. The optimization process involves extensive field calculations i.e. solving field problems governed by partial differential equations. The above shape modeling aspects also apply with meshless methods where a function across the domain determines the numerical solution of a given field problem. The option applied here will be meshless methods which are based on a nodes “cloud” and are dramatically less sensitive to the change in a material configuration. 					 				|	|Basic engineering sciences|	|Adaptive shape parameterization, 3D geometric modeling, Feature-based partitioning, Shape optimization, Meshless methods|

The disregard of the maritime cultural aspects reduces the cultural diversity in the reception of national literature, both authored/written and oral. With the premise that the attribute 'Adriatic' is a significant determinant of one of Croatia's cultural identities, this project aims to contribute to the research of the phenomenon of Croatian culture's maritimity in the area of oral literature narratives, both fictional and non-fictional, as well as narratives of national written literature in its synchronic and diachronic perspective. The outstanding value and specific contribution of this project is in covering a field that has not yet been researched in Croatian literary studies. The project is based on the idea of definition, interpretation and valorisation of the Adriatic component of Croatian literature and the systematic research of oral and recorded stories of various narrative and protonarrative types related to specific areas of the Adriatic space. The collected data will be systematized and subjected to a detailed analysis and textual interpretation from various perspectives: literary, linguistic, ethnological, cultural, antropological, comparative and the perspective of gender. The research will include various types of interpretation in the areas of stylistics, narratology, literary theory, dialectology, lexicology / lexicography, semiotics, rhetoric, ethnography and cultural anthropology. Results will be dissaminated through the publication of books and research papers in internationally cited journals and proceedings of the international conference on the subject of this project.

Clinical groups (patients with aphasias, dementias and dyslexia) will be included into the project; language breakdown in these clinical groups helps in the study of language processing in healthy adults and vice versa. It is generally assumed that the subtle changes in language processing in the aging population arise from the cognitive decay related to executive functions, not language per se. The decrease in the processing speed influences language processes that require fast execution or simultaneity. This results in a typical pattern of changes, different from the ones in clinical populations. Therefore, executive functions in these groups will be studied in order to build a comprehensive model of adult language processing. Theories of language processing (namely, Role and Reference Grammar - RRG) will be considered to define specific traces of language processing that assume fast execution or simultaneity and therefore should be the most vulnerable in aging population. These traces will be defined and described which will put Croatian into a cross-linguistic perspective in contemporary studies of linguistic aphasiology and provide coherent picture of age related changes in adult language system. 					 				|	|Logopedics|	|language processing, adult and elderly population, language disorders, executive functions, linguistic aphasiology|

The main goal of this project is to develop new or improve existing 3D robot vision methods for application in mobile robot manipulation tasks. The proposed research considers application of 3D sensors in execution of prototypical tasks which include object manipulation combined with autonomous motion in an unstructured environment. The focus of the research is on robot perception based on 3D point clouds obtained by 3D sensors, while motion planning and grasping are involved only for the purpose of evaluation of the developed vision-based solutions. The research will be conducted in three directions: (i) point cloud segmentation and 3D modelling; (ii) object recognition; (iii) mobile robot localization. In order to facilitate human-robot communication, a point cloud segmentation method will be developed which will create environment models in the form of separate geometric objects relevant for mobile robot manipulation, providing a user with a simple and intuitive means of defining robot manipulation tasks. Several novel approaches within the framework of a common feature-based object recognition pipeline will be developed with the purpose of increasing the computational efficiency while achieving a high precision-recall characteristic. Novel features for efficient hypothesis generation will be designed. A novel hypothesis probability estimation approach will be developed. Furthermore, application of a random evolutionary search algorithm and graph matching in object recognition will be investigated. The developed object recognition system will be extended and adapted for place recognition within a mobile robot localization framework. All developed approaches will be evaluated by experiments with a mobile robot manipulation. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|computer vision, robot manipulation, object recognition, robot localization, segmentation, 3D sensors|

The low-side and high-side switch, their drivers and the control circuitry are integrated into one package which minimizes the parasitic elements and allows switching frequencies up to 10 MHz. A driving-signal circuitry with high-precision adjustable timings is developed. This will allow the optimisation of dead-times with respect to the power conversion efficiency of a converter for any given set of the parameters of the integrated circuit (IC) package, external components and a printed circuit board (PCB). A special attention is given to the design of a level-shifter for a high-side switch. Besides driving the on-chip power switches, the developed driving signal circuitry is routed to external pins of the IC package to enable driving of the externally connected switches. Gallium-nitride (GaN) and silicon-carbide (SiC) semiconductor devices present a promising solution for a high-voltage and high-efficiency power conversion. In order to design a highly efficient converter for high-voltage switching applications by using GaN and SiC power transistors, the GaN/SiC DC-DC converter will be optimised by using adjustable driving-signal circuitry, which is designed at the beginning of the project. The developed methodology will allow the evaluation of the efficiency of the GaN and SiC devices in high-voltage switching applications as well as highly optimised design of the converters. The PCB makes a large part of the design and it has a dominant effect in determination of the electromagnetic compatibility and thermal properties of the converter. A simulation environment which will allow the electromagnetic-thermal co-optimisation of DC-DC converters will be developed. A statistical analysis of the parameters of a PCB and an IC package will be performed to ensure that the variations in the manufacturing process do not compromise the reliability and the efficiency of the designed converters. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|integrated circuit design, DC-DC converters, power electronics, GaN transistors, electromagnetic compatibility|

On the other hand, application of classic medical drills with no internal cooling capabilities significantly influence on the occurrence of thermal osteonecrosis. Cooling is usually performed by applying cooling fluid externally on the bone surface and the part of tool not in the bone during the drilling process. This approach has very limited effect on the temperature reduction because bone debris prevent contact of cooling fluid with tool cutting edges, and bone itself has very low thermal conductivity. Therefore, a group of activities have been proposed by this project focused on the development of new systems with the implementation perspective in the next generation of hand-held drilling machines. Their characteristics should potentially ensure on-line monitoring of the mechanical and thermal effects on the tool and bone using different types of sensors and advanced decision algorithms, exploitation of highly effective internally cooled medical drills, automated tool feed movement with potential implementation of high-speed drilling regimes, as well as the application of advanced adaptive control algorithms for cutting forces and drilling temperature limitation. Implementation of those features would ensure transition from completely hand-controlled drilling machines to semi-automatic systems, where only drilling location and desired tool direction/angle should be defined by the surgeon, while all other activities would be performed autonomously by the machine monitoring and control system. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|Drilling, Bone and joint surgery, Thermal osteonecrosis, Monitoring, Control, Internally cooled tool, Automated machining, Computational intelligence|

The electrification of the transport equipment and the shift of the freight shipments from road to more efficient rail are some of the key elements for the overall increase of energy efficiency in transport and reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions. This project puts emphasis on development of advanced electric drives for traction vehicles for passenger and freight transport running on tracks. Traditional approach to the design of electric drives has an emphasis on components without insufficient insight into the interaction among them and thus it fails to deliver the optimal performance of the overall traction system. The main objective of this project is to enhance the general approach to design of electric drive systems for traction applications by utilizing a synergetic approach to component design accompanied with advanced control algorithms to maximize the system performance and efficiency and minimize the life cycle cost of the vehicle. This objective will be achieved through: (i) development of software tools for computer aided design of electric drive components for traction applications using multiphysics approach with consideration of component interaction with the rest of the system, (ii) development of different traction power converters topologies for evaluation of various modulation and control methods, (iii) development of software environment for dynamic simulation of traction system performance which couples complex nonlinear models of system components with the models of control algorithm and vehicle dynamics, (iv) development of the electric drive control system based on optimal control approach which ensures maximum efficiency of the system during entire drive cycle of the vehicle.

A new sight proposed by this project is in the merging of so far separate research teams involved in the development of advanced textile materials, through targeted eco-driven surface modifications. Surface pre-treatments and modification will be carried out on selected sustainable textile materials, using environmentally friendly substances and processes, in order to attain antimicrobial, flame retardant, oil/hydrophobic, wellness or medical properties obtaining high added value textiles. Different environmentally friendly methods of microwave, ultrasound or plasma modification processes will be used to enhance targeted functionalities as well as to increase interfacial adhesion between fibres and polymer matrix in fibre reinforced composites. The other approach of the production of highly active surfaces which will have capability to block UV and microwave radiation, enhance oil and water repellence, antimicrobial, self-cleaning, and flame retardant properties is in the application of micro/nano-particles such as TiO2, ZnO, Cu, Ag and Au. These particles can be applied on the surface of fibers, textiles, clothing or inlayers for footwear. Detailed characterization of each treatment effectiveness, so as their effect on humans and the environment will be investigated. Laundering durability and maintenance properties are equally important as the effectiveness of developed advanced material. Introduction of novel eco-driven surface modification processes in textile production will be complemented by the risk analysis and sustainability issues, focusing onto production and product safety, usage and recyclability of newly developed product without significant environmental burden. Innovative textile products will be directed towards the needs of the textile, chemical, pharmaceutical or medical industries. 					 				|	|Textile technology|	|advanced materials, textiles, surface modification, fibre reinforced composites, nano-metal particles, LCA,|

Such changes in climatic conditions may reflect on the food contamination pattern through mycotoxin-producing moulds. Thus, mycotoxin-producing Aspergilli may become more frequent in our region, increasing the risk of exposure to their mycotoxin mixtures in food and the air of damp dwellings. From the mycotoxicological point of view, species from sections Flavi, Circumdati, Nigri, Versicolores and Terrei require particular attention due to the production of aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, sterigmatocystin and citrinin. The mechanism of toxicity of these mycotoxins has still not been elucidated. One of the possible mechanisms that plays a significant role in the immunotoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of mycotoxins is oxidative stress. This mechanism could be contravened by antioxidants such as resveratrol. Therefore, the objectives of this project include: 1) research on occurrence and genotyping of airborne and foodborne Aspergilli using the ITS/CaM region of DNA sequence-based analysis; 2) checking the ability of Aspergilli to produce mycotoxins in vitro and ex vivo using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry; 3) clarifying the involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of mycotoxins in cell lines and animal model by measuring lipid peroxidation, cell antioxidants and expression of heat shock proteins; 4) estimation of mycotoxin toxic interactions (additivity, synergism, antagonism) in binary and tertiary combinations at their EU regulatory limits using cell lines and statistical models, and 5) evaluation of resveratrol protection from oxidative stress. Our results will provide the base for recommendations and/or revision of current regulatory guidelines in order to minimize risks for human health. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|Aspergilli, mycotoxins, interactions, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity|

Ivica Rubelj, |	|Aging is a physiological process characterized by a gradual decline in physical fitness and other functional capabilities. The mechanisms of aging and possible actions of slowing down or ameliorating aging-related processes are poorly understood. In humans, one of the characteristics of old age is polypharmacy, which elevates risks of drug-drug interactions and drug-induced adverse reactions and organ toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These reactions may partially result from diminished drug metabolism and/or mainly from impaired activity/expression of various membrane transporters that are responsible for drug excretion in liver and kidneys. These both mechanisms have been poorly studied in senescent organs. Here we promote a hypothesis that the aging-induced oxidative stress, known to downregulate the activity/expression of the aging suppressor gene (Klotho) and to shorten the length of telomeres, also diminishes the activity/expression of various membrane transporters in liver and kidneys, and that these changes can be ameliorated by treating animals with antioxidants resveratrol and melatonin. The extent and the intensity of aging-related changes, and the beneficial effects of antioxidants may be sex-related. To test this hypothesis, we propose various biochemical and cell- and molecular-biological studies of aging parameters and aging-dependent expression of various membrane transporters in the mammalian liver and kidneys using a rat model of experimental aging. Possible aging-related decline in the expression of these transporters may explain a higher incidence (women &gt; man) of drug interactions and toxicity in old people. The studies will define the underlying cellular mechanisms that contribute to generation of the aging-related pathophysiological conditions in the liver and kidneys, and will indicate possible ways of their amelioration. Positive results may point to remedies to be used for improving the health of elderly people. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|aging, antioxidants, drug transporters, hepatotoxicity, liver, kidney, Klotho, membrane transporters, nephrotoxicity, oxidative stress, telomeres|

Today, DNA and RNA sequencing are now key components of research carried out in many laboratories. The total amount of available genomic data is increasing approximately tenfold every year, a rate much faster than Moore’s Law for computational processing power. The exponential growth of genomic datasets leads to a situation, where computing power becomes a critical issue. The overarching goal of the project is to develop accurate, fast algorithms and tools for analyzing the whole genome-sequencing data. The emphasis of the project is on the output data from the third-generation of sequencing machines that produce longer, more error-prone sequence reads. The basis of the project are sequence alignment algorithms, graph algorithms and signal processing methods. They will be implemented for DNA sequence assembly, sequenced RNA data and sequence similarity database search. The algorithms should feasibly handle data obtained from mammalian and plant genomes (sizes greater than one billion base pairs). Special emphasis will be put on multi-core, many-core and intra-core parallelism. Additionally, the algorithms should provide good scalability over the available underlying computational architecture. All implementations of algorithms will be performed in C/C++. The research will result in the development of novel algorithms tailored to specifications of current and future long-read sequencing data. The implemented methods will further the state-of-the-art of sequence similarity database search, RNA-seq mapping and DNA assembly, ideally providing researchers with methods that return results in feasible time with limited computational resources.

Suppose that we are interested in the probability of failure of the entire system, failure that occurs when certain subset of the subsystems fail, i.e. we are interested in the systemic risk. How do we model such a situation and estimate the systemic risk? Unfortunately, this is very difficult, and we are not very good at it, e.g. the order of magnitude of the probability of failure of a nuclear plant is still ungraspable. It seems that this is because most of the familiar correlation structures in probability are low-dimensional, or even one-dimensional. However, correlation structures in complex systems are high-dimensional and usual independence assumption is seriously violated. The goal of this research project is to find efficient algorithms for systemic risk measurement by defining a new class of models of high-dimensional correlation structures in a large collection of random variables. The defined models should be computationally tractable and simple enough so that one can bring them to data and use it for various applications in high-dimensional data analysis. In this project we will continue to use the methods of mathematical and computational modeling, specifically: complex networks, sparse estimation, and concentration of measure. With this approach, we have already obtained very important results, like an insight into the emergence of power-law and two-phase behavior in the financial market fluctuations. Also, with this approach we would like to better understand the basic mechanisms that underlie systemic risk and the stability of the complex systems (e.g. financial system). The need for scientific foundations for a systemic risk measure is more than an academic concern as different people around the world consider how to reduce the risks and costs of systemic crises. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|systemic risk, complex systems, network dynamics, sparsity, discrete time signals|

The vision for personal is an urgency today and already the new group of culture creatives is identified spearheading this movement. This vision is also embedded in the overall vision of Europe 2020 for creation of more just and inclusive societies and provision of greater quality of lives for all citizens. This proposition will be analysed from three aspects: by capturing the transformative power of past and present travel experience of the culture creatives, motivations and practises of pioneering change-makers who create transformational travel products and tourism stakeholders’ receptiveness to integrate transformational view of tourism into design of their products. The research will employ mixed-method approach, involving quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (in-depth interviews, focus groups, workshops, diary) methods.

In contrast to the existing studies, the research will focus on those whose values are transformed and will seek to capture the role of travel experience in that process, on the long term behavioural change following the travel in contrast to the existing focus on immediate post-trip attitude change. The research will also overcome the existing host – industry – guest divide, as it will include entrepreneurial perspective of transformative travel providers, mainstream industry players and host communities in the process of fostering activities which can facilitate societal transformation through tourism. 					 				|	|Economy|	|culture, tourism, transformation, values, behaviour, change|

Due to the complexity of the problems regarding the object of research, and in case the newly constructed test does not show satisfactory metric characteristics, a secondary aim is set which entails revalidation and selection of one or more existing “non-specific” tests which will be proven appropriate for each sport after testing the metric characteristics. The project is designed as a research in duration of 36 months. For the purposes of realization of the aims set, the research will be conducted on a sample of 300 subjects minimum, divided into subsamples according to sport, gender and age category (cadets, juniors, seniors). The project consists of three phases. In the first phase a Web page and computer application will be created for: input, storage, reviewing and monitoring of subjects and results, and, based on a pilot study and previous findings, a certain number of the existing “non-specific” measuring instruments will be selected. In the second phase of the project data will be collected on anthropometric characteristics and the level of anaerobic capacities of the subjects will be measured by field tests with confirmed metric characteristics. At the same time, the construction of a new specific measuring instrument will begin during the second phase. The third phase of the project includes the testing of metric characteristics of the newly constructed specific field test for assessing anaerobic capacities in kicking combat sports, as well as the selection of the existing tests appropriate for practical application on a specific sample. After the project is finished, selection normative according to sport, gender and age category will be created based on the obtained results. 					 				|	|Kinesiology|	|anaerobic capacity, combat sport, test construction, taekwondo, karate, kickboxing, fitness tests,|

Thus the prevention and protection against zoonotic parasites in fishery products designated for human consumption has recently become a priority. Consequently, health authorities and fishing industry have increasingly become aware of the significance of nematode genus Anisakis, which affects human health and the commercial value of fish products. Adriatic fish, marketed fresh, frozen, salted or marinated and exported to EC, are frequently rejected on the border because of Anisakis infection. Although considered one of the most significant emerging food-borne zoonosis, anisakiasis in many Mediterranean countries is still misdiagnosed or underestimated. AnGEL will deepen the knowledge on Anisakis with a multidisciplinary approach, studying the fish as paratenic, cetaceans as the final and men as accidental host. It will start by identifying anisakids species by molecular tools in picarel and damselfish, that are particular dish in culinary tradition of SE Adriatic islands where a significant level of anti-Anisakis IgE in local population was found. It will evaluate histopathological effect of the nematode in the digestive tract of the final host in order to evaluate Anisakis carcinogenic potential, as well as its transciptomic signature during migration through hosts. It will assess larval multixenobiotic resistance mechanisms helping to design more effective therapy, and measure anti-Anisakis seroprevalence in population employed in the fish processing industry by indirect ELISA. Lastly, AnGEL will encompass resulting data in a risk analysis frame, aiming to the design of measures for the safe alimentary seafood production and strengthening of risk communication to stakeholders. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|Anisakis spp., zoonosis, seroprevalence, patohistology, transcriptomic, risk analysis|

Within the project, a progressive (model and in-situ) approach will be accomplished to reveal crucial alterations in the marine ecosystem. Initial investigations will imply model experiments on the interaction of selected OM (polysaccharides, lipids, polymeric organic matter containing N catalytic atoms) with micronutrient metals (Fe, Co, Cu, Zn and Cd). Additionally, phytoplankton monoculture incubation under various growth conditions (nutrient concentrations and temperature variations) will be included in order to comprehend multiple impacts on the phytoplankton OM production and micronutrients metals distribution. Model experiments will be followed by in-situ investigations at the selected oligotrophic and eutrophic areas of the Adriatic Sea. This will give holistic informations on the natural marine biochemical cycles and linkage between OM and micronutrient metals. In-situ investigations will be focused on the seasonal variations of the OM and micronutrient appearance and concentrations in combination with physico-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, O2), and dissolved and particulate organic carbon content, surface-active organic substances and macronutrients (PO4, NO3, NO2, NH4). These investigations will be assessed by intercomparable and multimethodological approaches using various chromatographic to electrochemical techniques. Finally, taking into account all obtained results an important part of the natural marine ecosystem processes will be characterized in the prospective of climate changes. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|organic matter, lipids, acidic polysaccharides, micronutrient metals, oligotrophy, eutrophy, monocultures, field work|

Electrical discharge plasma is one of these more promising techniques. Plasmas formed directly in liquid inactivate microorganisms and without significant increase in temperature during the treatment. However, knowledge gaps regarding the nature of sterilization, inactivation mechanism and the plasma reactor design have been identified as major constraints for the applicability of this technology in food industry. Thus the main goal of the proposed project is to design and develop a non-thermal plasma reactor for the treatment of fruit juices and milk and optimize it to maximize the utilization of UV light and chemical species produced by plasma. To achieve this goal, we propose to address the following research objectives (R): R1 Develop and optimize a liquid-phase plasma reactor for treatment of fruit juices and milk. R2 Characterize the chemical and electrical properties of the liquid plasmas. R3 Evaluate the ability of the liquid-phase plasma to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms in suspensions of pure culture microorganisms and suspended in fruit juices and milk respectively. R4 Determine inactivation mechanism of the plasma treatments on microorganisms R5 Determine the effect of the plasma treatments on the physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory properties of juices and milk. The significance of the proposed research lies in the development of a novel plasma reactor as well as acquires new knowledge regarding the science behind the forthcoming plasma technology which can then be applied towards introducing and potentially replacing current processing technologies with plasma. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|Electrical discharge plasma, liquid-phase plasma reactor, liquid food, physico-chemical properties, nutritional and sensory properties|

At the same time, they are not ready to change their eating habits – reduce intake of bakery products, fast food etc. and increase intake of fresh fruit and vegetable, whole grain products etc. Therefore, food industry is challenged to create products that are consumed every day (bread, snacks etc.) by large population, which are both enriched with bioactive substances and have desired sensory properties. The aim of this project is to develop new functional and enriched products based on extrusion process. Enriched grains (wheat, maize) will be used as basic material. The improvement and supplementation with biologically active (antioxidants, minerals, vitamns, fibre) will be done by addition of by-products from food industry (fruit and vegetable pomaces, oil cakes) in extrusion process. Extrusion will be used to produce final products: expanded snack products and pasta, as well as modified flours which will be used in production of bakery products and biscuits. All processes - extrusion of snack products and pasta, extrusion for flour modification, pasta drying, baking) will be optimised using response surface methodology. All products will be tested for chemical, physical, thermophysical properties, and optimal products will be sensory analysed. The results of project will be array of flours and final products with defined recipes and optimal production conditions, along with defined application of food industry by-products that significantly load environment and are not currently exploited to satisfying extent. In the project multidisciplinary approach will be applied – from agronomist, over food technologist and process engineers to sensory experts.

Additionally, they may provide numerous positive effects to the human health (such as risk reduction for: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension etc.). Due to large structural diversity among different groups of BACs and their physical/chemical properties it is important to identify/optimize the most effective extraction methods required to isolate and/or separate them from other plant components. Hence, various innovative extraction techniques (e.g. microwave-, ultrasound- and high-pressure- assisted extraction) will be tested for plant extracts production with high BACs content from selected MAPs grown in Croatia. Each applied extraction technique will be optimized with regards to particular MAP, increasing extraction yield, enhancing quality of extract, shortening extraction time, and decreasing solvent consumption. MAPs extracts and/or BACs will be analyzed for antioxidant properties with application of various assays (e.g. total antioxidant, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and free radical scavenging, metal chelating activities). Antiproliferative effects against tumor cells and possible protective role from lipid oxidation (including antioxidant activity) will be tested in appropriate cell line model system. The MAP extracts (dried/liquid) and BACs (extracted and/or purified separately or in mixtures) will be studied in animal models for bioavailability; absorption; antioxidant activity; as ingredient for functional food products (fortified beverages and snack bars based on Mediterranean fruits), and for possible use in diabetic/hypercholesteremic management. The obtained results may provide novel opportunities for functional product categories that are likely to have positive benefits on human health. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|medicinal and aromatic plants, innovative technologies, plant extracts, bioactive compounds, bioavailability, antioxidant properties|

MSMTBs allow ex ante review of the effects of changes in tax-benefit system. Therefore, they are particularly valuable in the reform analysis and planning. Unlike in other EU countries, where the use of MSMTBs is widespread, the development of MSMTBs in Croatia is still in its infancy. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to apply microsimulation models of Croatian taxes and benefits in public policy and academic analysis. By application of MSMTBs in analysing contemporary economic and policy problems, the project will demonstrate the usefulness of these models, and attract the attention of public administration leaders (PALs) and researchers in Croatia. The research project has three objectives: (1) Develop the microsimulation model of Croatian taxes and benefits – miCROmod: miCROmod will be a conventional static arithmetic MSMTB that simulates social security contributions, personal income tax, guaranteed minimum income, child benefit, parental benefits and unemployment benefit. miCROmod will also include: (a) a local government supplement, modelling taxes and benefits in the City of Zagreb and (b) a behavioural supplement, simulating the impact of changes of tax-benefit instruments on the labour supply and gross wages. (2) Employ miCROmod and EUROMOD in the analysis of tax-benefit reform scenarios: miCROmod and EUROMOD (a comprehensive MSMTB for the EU) will then be used in the the analysis of the effect of a number of tax-benefit reforms on income inequality, poverty rates and incentives to work. These reforms cover: (a) Child benefits, (b) Personal income tax (c) In-work policies, and (d) Local social benefits.

Phraseology is primarily a linguistic and culturally multi-layered discipline. The basic unit of phraseology is a phraseme (idiom). It consists of at least two components. Its characteristic is that it is not created in the process of speaking, but is included in discourse as an already known whole. Its main features are continuity of use, integrity and a solid structure, higher or lower degree of desemanticization, a colourful nature, expressiveness and connotative meaning. The project will primarily include theoretical work on analyzing Croatian phrasemes from various aspects. Furthermore, with the application of the method of contrastive analysis, structural, semantic, etymological, motivational and cultural similarities and differences between Croatian idioms and idioms of other Slavic and non-Slavic languages will be examined. We consider the latter to be extremely important because in this way Croatian idioms would be placed in the context of European idioms. The second part of the project proposal relates to phraseographical work. Phraseography is an area that deals with the issue of compiling phraseological dictionaries. The publication of several phraseological dictionaries is planned. Particularly important will be the two phraseological dictionaries which will be completely new in a conceptual sense (a trilingual dictionary of associations and a dictionary of gender-marked phrasemes). All dictionaries will be compiled according to the latest phraseographical methodology. In addition, we should mention the work on the updated edition of the Bibliography of Croatian phraseology. We believe both of these aspects to be very important for the recognition of Croatian phraseology and phraseography within European phraseology, phraseography, Slavic studies and philology. 					 				|	|Philology|	|phraseme, phraseology, phraseography, dictionaries, contrastive linguistics, Croatian, Slavic languages, non-Slavic languages|

Ecological interactions of farm installations are reflected through acting as new ecological niches for the local fish where also altered wild fish physiology and behaviour may occur. Another environmental risk is the potential impact of releasing farmed fish into the wild, through accidental escape or deliberate restocking. Escapes or releases of the domesticated aquaculture fish pose a potential risk of adverse effects on native fish gene pools. To better understand the complexity of aquaculture impacts on the native populations, this project will take advantage of cutting edge instrumental and genetic approaches to support aquaculture activity and management, as well as the protection of marine environment. This includes: (i) using novel stereoscopic camera system and multivariable analysis of proxy measure of fitness to asses do farms function as ecological traps for wild fish, (ii) using forensically validated genetic tools to assess genetic structure of wild/farmed fish and shellfish, (iii) using cutting edge genetic analytical approach to trace the origin of farmed fish and to monitor genetic interactions between fish from aquaculture and their wild conspecifics, and finally (iv) validation of the impact of oyster spat translocation between geographically distinct farming locations on genetic structure of native oysters populations in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea. Thus, this project addresses the common European challenge to develop sustainable aquaculture through improved competitiveness and environmentally-friendly production. As the potential adverse effects of aquaculture affect all EU countries, international collaboration will be implemented. The outcome of the project will be available to the researchers, the industry, policy makers and the general public. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|Aquaculture, Impact, Wild fish and shellfish populations, ecological traps, escapees, genetic interactions|

Our project proposes comprehensive study of bacterial community within water column, sediment and fish as indicator of the aquatic environmental health status and its potential implications to human health. The project seeks to understand the genetic diversity of bacterial isolates in the aquatic environment, the relationships between environmental isolates, those from the healthy fish and from fish with clinical symptoms. These data are necessary to predict the origin and spreading pathways of bacterial indicators of water quality, as well as potentially pathogenic bacteria, both for fish and humans. Antibiotic resistance profiles will be explored to determine a potential link between selected model bacteria and their resistance, and the effects of different environmental stress factors. The overall strategy of the work plan is to implement a multidisciplinary approach for the examination of the complex bacterial ecosystem in the aquatic environment. Within the partnership, four tasks have been identified, equating to resolving of specific problem connected with aquatic microbial ecology: 1. Sampling network design and rationale, 2. Fish as model organisms, 3. Selected Model Bacteria and 4. Impact on human health. Research will be carried out using the infrastructures and expertise present within the consortium. The project will bring together state of the art research from currently fragmented research fields in the same area. This will create a basis for further actions in the prevention of diseases and disorders in fish caused by potential pathogens. Improved environmental sustainability will enhance the overall economical viability of the aquaculture sectors, concerned with lowering environmental impacts resulting from current practices.

It is expected that this work will provide data for understanding a number of important issues regarding behavioral and possibly biological aspects of human groups during a time when Late Glacial hunter gatherers were forced to change and adapt to a changing environmental and other pressures. Presence of Mousterian artefacts at one of the sites, and Upper Paleolithic tool types at another suggests two populations (i.e. Neandertals and anatomically modern humans) were present in the region during the Late Pleistocene. Data from the proposed excavations may provide a basis to test some of the highly debated questions regarding the relation of biological population to behavioral aspects (e.g. whether Neandertals or anatomically modern humans were responsible for Early Upper Paleolithic, is there a sharp distinction in behavior and anatomy between these groups etc. Furthermore, at one site early Mesolithic is documented, while at another Late Mesolithic is present, allowing similar issues regarding behavior and other aspects to be tested, including issues related to the transition to Neolithic (agricultural) lifestyle. A comparison of data between all four sites could provide us with a basis for testing of issues related to changing life ways, land use, movement patterns, site use, biological aspects (similarities and differences), contact zones, mobility, continuity, etc. at times of changing climatic and environmental conditions and thus help us to understand this crucial time period, in particular, and how humans respond to such changes, in general.

The project considers the cognitive and practical sequences of the technological development of shipbuilding and seafaring, studying the relationship between technology on one hand and the political, economic and cultural/historical context on the other. It focuses on issues from all periods of the human past (Prehistory, Classical Antiquity, Middle Ages and Early Modern period) through active fieldwork, archival research and virtual reality experimentation. From the problematic histories of the Illyrian lemboi and Liburnian liburnae, to the complex issues of the large late Renaissance merchantmen, it provides a comprehensive overview of the past achievements, and introduces into Croatian research the systematic methodological approach to the study of the ships’ hulls. Taking into consideration global state-of-the-art practices in the fields of nautical archaeology and maritime history, the project aims to introduce cutting edge methodologies of study of ancient ships, their equipment and cargoes. It will foster an innovative interdisciplinary approach in the process of research, recording and interpretation of the most significant direct material evidence of the Eastern Adriatic maritime past, while promoting international collaboration and networking among young researchers. Such concept will have great potential for community outreach and wider public interest, especially through promoting project in public media as well as using new knowledge in Croatian touristic promotion. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|nautical archaeology, shipbuilding, seafaring, Adriatic Sea, 3D modellin, underwater robotics, history of technology|

The active components in such systems will be aromatic hydrazone derivatives. They will be synthesized by condensation reactions of hydrazide and differently substituted aldehydes or ketones. Since different tautomeric and isomeric forms of hydrazones can have diverse chelating properties, the detailed study of the corresponding equilibria is important for successful application of these compounds and will be performed within the project. Protonation properties and kinetics of hydrolysis of hydrazones in solvents containing water will be examined. For structural characterization of ligands in solution mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, and different spectroscopic techniques (NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence, IR and Raman spectroscopy) will be used. The computational studies will be carried out as well. The complexation reactions of hydrazones with selected metal ions and radionuclides will be investigated in solution. Whenever possible, complex stability constants will be determined and solid complexes will be isolated. Based on the results obtained, spectrophotometric and/or spectrofluorimetric methods for metal ions determination will be developed. The selectivity of the proposed methods will be further improved using extraction procedure. The influence of surfactants on the extraction systems will be explored. Furthermore, hydrazones abilities as extraction chromatographic resins towards selected radionuclides will be investigated. Prepared hydrazones and their complexes will be screened for biological activity on selected microbial species and fungi. Finally, the correlation of the hydrazones structures and their physico-chemical properties will be proposed, which is of great importance for successful applications of such compounds as bioactive agents or analytical reagents. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Hydrazones, complexes, structure, solution chemistry, extraction, radiometry, MS, NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence, IR, Raman, theoretical study|

Drago Marguš, |	|Natural protected areas (NPAs) are a crucial part of nature conservation; many of them are tourist hotspots. Managers of NPAs have to balance environmental protection and tourism to maximize socio-economic benefits while avoiding irreparable environmental consequences. Since 1978, carrying capacity for tourists (CCT) has been recognized and legislated as a crucial tool in finding the balance. CCT is traditionally defined as the maximum number of people concurrently visiting an area without irreversibly damaging physical, economic, and/or socio-cultural environment. In practice, managers determine acceptable level of environmental damage, and then use adaptive management to achieve and maintain that damage level. We propose a more conservation-oriented approach of estimating CCT that maximizes nature protection. Although every tourist damages the environment, he/she also contributes to protection by providing financial assets. Without revenues from tourism, protection is significantly underfunded because meeting protection and educational goals of NPAs requires costly activities such as research, oversight, mitigation, and management. We propose to estimate CCT as the maximum number of visitors for which the marginal contribution to nature protection is positive, with the requirement that visitor satisfaction not be compromised. We will first formalize the estimation procedure, then identify tourist activities with their consequences on the environment and socio-economic parameters, develop general models for common factors affecting environmental quality of the NPAs, and integrate the models into a GIS-based framework. Finally, we will demonstrate the approach by estimating CCT for two very different protected areas crucial for Croatian tourism and the local economy: NP Krka and PP Telašćica. While the new way of estimating CCT will initiate a paradigm shift in NPA management, the two applications will contribute to Croatia's nature conservation and economy. 					 				|	|Biology|	|carrying capacity, nature protected area management methods, conservation, environmental modeling, calculation, GIS, tourism, NP Krka, PP Telašćica|

The onset of the disease is mainly associated with the immune status, gut microbiota and food intake. The current scientific knowledge of specific triggers and diagnostic markers is limited; therefore, new data on gut microbiota, inflammatory, endocrine and nutritional status are required to better understand the IBD pathophysiology. It this study we will thoroughly explore host-gut microbiota interactions in order to define novel strategies for management of IBD. We will collect intestine biopsies, stool and blood samples from 40 newly diagnosed IBD patients and 20 non-IBD control individuals, as well as record their nutritional status. Since majority of the gut microorganisms are not culturable, we will use the in house available next-generation sequencing to characterize the composition of the microbiota in collected samples. Moreover, specific blood biomarkers, including cytokines, growth factors and hormones, will be determined using novel and highly sensitive proximity extension assays, recently developed in our laboratories. Collectively, these results will support better stratification of patients and initiate an appropriate therapy. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|IBD, microbiota, blood biomarker, tissue, translational research, clinical research|

Structure may be sometimes exposed to unexpected conditions, let say adverse or hazard conditions. These conditions may cause failures making structure incapable to perform the function for which it has been designed. The task is to make an assessment of the structure behaviour at mentioned conditions and decide if the structure is capable for further operation. This means the assessment should provide an answer if the structure has sustained irreparable damage. Therefore, the main objective is to provide an assessment of structure behaviour, by comparing of the parameters like stress, strain, crack occurring, etc., caused by certain load level and temperature at this unexpected limit state with those allowed by material properties. To assess structural behaviour in operation at limit state, the following research sub-objectives should be accomplished: testing of material properties for the different environmental conditions; definition of impact energy as well as the determination of the crack driving force and life assessment of structural elements; evaluation of the semi-rigid structural joints/connections behaviour; development of a numerical algorithm for optimization of semi-rigid framed structures; creep buckling simulations of composite beam-type structures; proper constitutive modelling at limit operating conditions (i.e. plasticity, damage, thermomechanical coupling); application of new materials to be used at limit state – nanocomposites. Targeted structures are single and multi storey steel buildings, rigs, high-power electrical transmission towers, ship structures, etc. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|structures, material properties, experimental investigations, numerical investigations, limit state, assessment of structural behaviour|

The diagnosis, which is usually given during the preschool period, depends on the education and experience of human evaluators, which can be susceptible to personal bias. The ongoing collaboration between the researchers from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER) and Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences (ERF) initiated the use of humanoid robots in the process of ASD diagnostic procedures in preschool children. The goal of the project is the development of a robot-based diagnostic protocol and testing of its verification in clinical settings. The robots will be used as ASD co-evaluators to help a human evaluator to assess the child behavior objectively. To the best of our knowledge, such a robot-based ASD diagnostics system will be the first of its kind. Technically, this means developing specific robot skills and behaviors to be deployed within the standard clinical diagnostic procedure of ASD. The robots will have two functions: observation and quantitative measurement of child’s social responses; and performance of standardized social presses designed to provoke child response. This involves actions such as analyses of the audio signal and differentiation of vocalizations and speech, detection of eye-gaze direction, performance of different actions and gestures and utilization of human-robot and robot-robot interaction to attract child attention. Our interdisciplinary approach includes ERF's development of diagnostic protocol and its testing on children with and without ASD and FER's realization of needed robot behaviors using methods and algorithms from social signal processing, computer vision, machine learning and cognitive reasoning. This involves work on cooperation, cognition and human-robot interaction, focusing on multimodal communication. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|social robotics, humanoid robots, autism, small children, diagnostics, rehabilitation|

Our research proposal fits very well with this recent development. First of all, the work of Arthur has its local application in the classification of representations of discrete series that was done by Moeglin and Tadić. Based on those results we plan to pursue the following investigations in the representation theory of p-adic groups. We would like to compute the Jacquet modules of discrete series representations completely.This will help us understand representations parabolically induced from those discrete series (generalized principal series) completely. This will have consequence on the problems of determination of complementary series for classical groups a problem related to the classification of unitary representations. Results of Gan, Savin and Ichino will help us extend some of those results to metaplectic groups. This will have important consequence on the determination of theta correspondence for dual pairs consisting of odd orthogonal and metaplectic groups such as explicit determination of all theta lifts. In the theory of automorphic forms, we would like to understand the construction of Arthur and Moeglin more explicitly. This will construct new series of square integrable representations; some special cases were obtained earlier by Muić, and Muić and Hanzer.This will give locally many interesting unitary representations which are more complicated than that has appeared in earlier works of Speh, Rogawski, Tadić, Muić, Savin, and Hanzer. We will apply those methods to study cohomology and poles of automorphic L-functions. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|automorphic forms, representations, Eisenstein series, cuspidal forms, theta correspondence|

The geopolitical strategy of Rome in conquered regions was to encourage the integration process, where the Roman army gave its contribution. Archaeological data testify that the indigenous communities of Illyricum reacted differently to this process. Some were willing to accept the Roman heritage (e.g. Liburnians), while the others (e.g. Delmatae) were providing resistance. Given previous research today we have a number of valuable studies about certain aspects of Roman domination. However, they are primarily focused either on the ancient written sources or the archaeological material from Dalmatia and Pannonia. This research of the integration would cover for the first time the Roman military presence on the area of Croatia. The main focus is on the Roman military sites along the Dalmataean and the the Danube limes. New data will be derived using the methodology purposely created for this project and includes archaeological survey, classification, comparison and evaluation of all available data both archaeological and ancient sources with the application of the variable of geographic origin. Such research has never been undertaken in Croatia. The results would fill the informational gaps that exist for this part of the Empire through the analysis of the largest possible amount of information about the Roman army activities and the integration of indigenous people. The project leader’s research has focused so far on the problems of Roman provincial archaeology. Many years of her successful research of and of all the collaborators guarantee the sustainability of the approach and the successful implementation of the project objectives. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Roman Empire, Danube, Mediterranean, mobility, economy, Roman military, local elite.|

We identified two of them as important: huge amount of data delivered from the real world via sensing devices, and computing power required for its processing. Both challenges are targeted in our project proposal, as well as some advanced applications of the proposed solutions. For decades, Nyquist limit sets the achievable work range of digital electronic systems operating in an analogue world. Using our previous research and expertise in causal splines, adaptive wavelets, sparse representations, and advanced system design, we will develop an original system that works beyond the Nyquist limit. Sub-Nyquist sampling in a union of analogue subspaces and compressive sensing are research topics used to achieve this goal. Both approaches result in applications that go beyond the known limits: they result in novel imaging techniques, advanced radar and sonar devices, wide-band software defined radios, as well as in advanced speech and audio processing systems. They rely on sparse representation of signals, sophisticated reconstruction and signal processing algorithms, as well as on intelligent hardware implementations that mix analogue and digital subsystems. The researchers gathered in this project team have research experience in causal splines, adaptive wavelets and sparse signal modeling, as well as in design of advanced analogue and digital systems. They have developed various applications in image, audio and speech signal processing. We will develop an original beyond Nyquist system based on our causal splines. We will use our adaptive systems and fast L1 minimization algorithms to achieve sparse representations needed in compressive sensing. The results will be used in design of novel sub-Nyquist systems, whose realization will rely on our advanced system design. We will develop its applications in 3D, image, audio and speech signal processing. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|sub-Nyquist sampling, compressive sensing, causal splines, sparse representations, adaptive wavelets, advanced system design|

Many classes of organic, inorganic or hybrid materials are produced by process of precipitation (crystallization) in which the size, morphology, chemical and structural composition could be tuned by the strict control of formation conditions. Process by which living organisms produce hard tissues is known as biomineralization and such tissues are, actually, the organic-inorganic composites. In comparison to their geological analogues, biominerals have the superior mechanical and chemical properties that are a consequence of just a minor presence of extracellular matrix proteins or polysaccharides, as well as of the specific confined environment in which the process occur. In addition, such materials are produced from aqueous systems, chemically neutral precursors, at low temperature and pressure, thus inspiring the scientists investigating the biomimetic syntheses routes for design of functional materials for advanced application. In order to contribute to the understanding of basic interactions between the mineral phases and complex macromolecules, underlying biomineralization, we propose the investigations in which the representative inorganic salts (calcium carbonates &amp; phosphates) will be precipitated in a presence of simple and representative organic molecules (acidic and hydrogen bonding amino acids and custom-designed small peptides) while the complexity of systems will be systematic increased by confining the precipitation in polysaccharide hydrogel or synthetic vesicular microenvironment. Particular attention will be paid on a role of the amorphous and other precursor phases on formation of stable modifications relevant for biomineralization. Besides the precipitation kinetic analyses, the advanced characterization techniques (HR-TEM, EPR, confocal microscopy) will be applied in order to reveal the mechanisms of organic molecules – mineral surface interactions. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Biomineralization, Calcium Phosphates, Calcium Carbonates, Precipitation, Model organic molecules|

However, the effects of different enological procedures on biological activity of wine are poorly investigated. The overall aim of this project, which represents an interdisciplinary research effort of experts from fields of biotechnology and biomedicine, is to investigate how different enological procedures in wine making (changes of maceration time, partial/complete dealcoholization, aging of wine) may affect its biological activity. This also includes investigation of potential differences in distinctive biological effects between wines obtained by the technology of white and red wine production. In contrast to the process of red wine production, in the white wine production there is no maceration in contact with grape seeds and skins, and only fermentation of immediately separated grape juice occurs. So, biological potentials of white wines may considerably differ from that of red wines. Conversely, if even short maceration is allowed in the process of white wine making, polyphenolic content and antioxidant potential of such wines is significantly enhanced. There are several studies demonstrating superior effects of red versus white wine on certain cardiovascular parameters. However, epidemiological evidence demonstrating specific benefits of red over white wine is poor and conclusive studies comparing the two are missing. Detailed biochemical analyses of all test wines will be performed and their biochemical properties will be correlated with their biological activity. Among numerous biological effects of wine and its constituents, this project focuses on cardiovascular, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of wine that will be examined on a spectrum of in vitro and in vivo biological systems including small laboratory animals and human volunteers. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|wine, wine technology, cardiovascular, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant|

Efforts have been made to identify a biological correlate of schizophrenia yet without straightforward results. Thus, the methodology in the search of biomarkers has to be revised including: 1) longitudinal studies of first episode schizophrenia (FEP) patients, to overcome the confounders from previous studies (i.e. cross sectional design, heterogeneous sample of patients, confounding effects of medication); 2) integration of different approaches when searching for biomarkers. A large body of genetic studies concluded that schizophrenia results from the gene x environment interaction and once again revitalized the stress diathesis model of schizophrenia. Thus, we will examine a set of biomarkers according to this model including the psychopathological status, neurocognitive functioning and stress response by using brain functional and neuroimaging (single photon emission computed tomography - SPECT) methods in 150 FEP patients vs. controls and their changes during the FEP and subsequent remission in 18-month longitudinal follow up. Secondly, we will examine the course of treatment of previously unmedicated FEP patients by using pharmacogenetic analysis. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) will be performed in collaboration with the research group of Toronto, further expanding our international collaboration. We will study alteration in number and distribution, as well as morphology and chemical properties of specific neuron subclasses in histologically prepared human cortical tissue of schizophrenic subjects in the region that synaptic alteration was suggested by in-vivo functional and structural imaging (SPECT). This project is a continuation of our previous studies, but it also brings a innovative multidisciplinary approach to identify biomarkers in FEP.

In the case of antimicrobial peptides, measured biological activity and therapeutic index data will be collected from published papers with the goal of constructing robust and accurate predictive models. A large amount of data regarding the 20 natural amino acids attributes will also be collected and analysed. We plan to propose new scales of amino-acid attributes that may be a basis for a multitude of future studies. In our experience, construction of good predictive models is not possible without using biophysical insights to propose appropriate molecular descriptors crucial for data-mining procedure and model building. These models should be based on newly developed molecular descriptors. Study of molecular descriptors will be important part of this project, their extremal properties (as indicators of the most active compounds), their complexity of calculation (since exhaustive search for optimal compounds can be computationally demanding) and their interrelationships. Dedicated algorithms for in-silico identification or proposal of structures with the desired properties will be built and verified through synthesis, characterization and testing of predicted antimicrobials. The activity, selectivity, conformation and mechanism of action of lead compounds will be explored using biophysical, biochemical and microbiological techniques. Preliminary investigations by our group of graduate, doctoral and postdoctoral biophysics students has already led to the identification of two designed peptides as being very active against pan-resistant Acetinobacter baumanni, so that initial drug development is within the scope of this project with the aim of finding new classes of non-toxic peptide antibiotics active against multidrug resistant bacteria. 					 				|	|Biology|	|Antimicrobial peptides, Molecular descriptors, Therapeutic index, Drug development, Design, Data-mining, Antibiotics, Multidrug resistance|

Specific phytoplankton ecological preferences drive their temporal and spatial distribution, reflecting their dependence on specific temperature ranges, light levels, nutrient availability and other environmental gradients. Hence, some phytoplankton taxa can be used as water mass tracers (biotracers). We hypothesize that picophytoplanktonic prokaryote Prochlorococcus and nanophytoplanktonic eukaryotes coccolithophores: Emiliania huxleyi and/or Gephyrocapsa oceanic are such organisms, and can be used for tracing water masses in the Adriatic. Here, we propose interdisciplinary study where oceanography, taxonomy of phytoplankton and molecular recognition are combined to detect and follow water masses. Two winter cruises in the southern Adriatic will be conducted with station positions and sampling depths defined in situ. Water mass detection will be based on pre-defined physical characteristics; however, we also plan to use optical measurements in conjunction with the proposed sampling to develop an optical based criterion for definition of the targeted water masses. Phytoplankton community will be assessed using multiple tools to confirm the presence and to determine distribution, abundance and diversity of the proposed biotracers in sampled water masses. With the variability and trends of the Adriatic circulation as well as the water mass characteristics brought on by changing climate, we believe that proposed study is timely and needed as it is offering a holistic and integrated approach to oceanography of the Adriatic. Most importantly, this study is proposing to develop a new set of interdisciplinary tools that will be essential for future research activities. 					 				|	|Biology|	|Adriatic Sea, climate changes, water mass tracers, cyanobacteria, coccolithophorids|

Several studies have shown that infratentorial lesions are related to conversion rate and long-term prognosis for patients with CIS and thus may help to identify patients at high risk for earlier occurrence of clinically relevant disability. Bearing in mind the poor correlation between clinical symptoms and MRI findings there is a need for ancillary tools in the evaluation of brainstem pathology in MS. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of the brainstem evoked potentials score (bilateral AEP, bilateral ocular and cervical VEMP and bilateral tongue SSEP), the modified evoked potentials score (combination of brainstem evoked potentials score and VEP and SSEP of the median and tibial nerve) and standardized autonomic nervous system testing (Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS)) in the prediction of conversion from CIS to MS and accumulation of future disability. After 24 months of follow-up, this study could reveal the prognostic value of the brainstem EP score, modified EP score and CASS in patients with CIS on a number of parameters including: time until second relapse, accumulation of disability, accumulation of MRI lesions in the first 6 months, time to conversion from CIS to MS according to the 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria, number of relapses in the first 2 years of follow up. It can be presumed that the brainstem EP score and CASS score as direct and indirect measures of brainstem dysfunction, respectively will prove as reliable markers of future disability of CIS and MS patients. As a consequence, this would allow us to start more appropriate treatment in a subset of patients with higher probability of worse outcome. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|clinically isolated syndrome, multiple sclerosis, evoked potentials, autonomic nervous system testing, brainstem|

Higher automatization reduces the need for human labour and China manufacturing is posing a considerable threat. Manufacturing companies in developed countries are seeking ways to stay competitive on the global market since a considerable part of their GDP is acquired by manufacturing, but unfortunately, shrinking. At the moment there are two large scale projects exploring manufacturing sector: EMS and GMRG Survey. Both surveys look at different aspects of manufacturing and engage different countries. EMS covers 18, while GMRG survey includes 24 countries including China, Taiwan and others. The main objective for application is to enable Croatian scientist to be equal partners in such large scale projects and access data from other countries and carry out comparative analyses that will benefit the researchers and manufacturing industry in Croatia. It must be emphasized that Faculty of Business and Economics is the partner for both EMS and GMRG project for number of years but never had the chance to exploit the privileges. Both surveys explore in detail manufacturing so willingness of the industry to participate is essential. In order to do that, Faculty of Business and Economics will have to provide several workshops on which participants will see the comparative results between countries and be motivated to participate in the next round. All the acquired knowledge will be shared with industry experts and all the results will be available on the internet page of the host Institution. The project is interdisciplinary because it investigates the manufacturing technology and processes, as well as the usage of novel materials. Therefore colleagues from Engineering Sciences are participating in the project since the latest results in manufacturing research shows that advanced technology and advanced materials are the only source left for sustaining the competitive advantage in comparison to China. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Manufacturing, manufacturing practices, technology, organizational innovations, EMS, GMRG, Croatia|

The project focuses on translations of narrative fiction into and from Croatian over a span of a hundred years, i.e. in the 20th century. International scholarship in the field of children’s literature has recently turned towards comparative children’s literature, focusing on translation, intercultural transfer and contacts among languages and cultures. In so doing, it intersects with recent trends in translation studies in general. The proposed project aims to establish a team of researchers who would develop such an area of research in Croatia. The goal is to set research standards and fine-tune appropriate methodology. The researchers intend to assemble a bibliography of translated children’s books and crossover texts. Records will be analysed and interpreted with respect to the source and intermediary languages represented, historical trends, book selection relative to the canon of children’s literature, publishing practices and other aspects. Next, a selection of published books will be analysed for translation strategies at several levels of discourse. The researchers will address linguistic, narrative, cultural and intercultural aspects, and focus on uncovering translation norms and domestication strategies. Croatian books translated into other languages will receive special attention. Finally, the results will be analysed and interpreted to explain the documented translation flows, trends, and the dynamics of literary relationships in the 20th century, from the Croatian perspective and in the international context. The proposed project will present a sound foundation for further development of the established area of research and of a wider international cooperation in the future. 					 				|	|Philology|	|Croatian children's literature, translation strategies, narrative fiction, 20th century, intercultural transfer, canon, discourse, crossover text|

The proposed project will research the burial ritual as a reflection of identity of Iron Age communities, mostly by applying the contextual approach. The material culture will not be viewed only as a typological category, but rather it will be linked to the context of the grave inventory and the burial ritual. The burial ritual and material culture associated with graves clearly suggest that the issue of identity of the Iron Age cultural groups should be analysed at the level of individual communities. We will carry out a comparative analysis of contemporary and conceptually similar grave inventories discovered in different burial contexts and belonging to different cultural groups. By doing so, we will attempt to examine and define some aspects of the material culture and ritual context which make up the identity of the deceased, at the level of individual communities. Such results would enable us to establish which of the identified elements are used when defining the identity at the level of a community, cultural group or a wider unit, and whether such an approach is justifiable and universally applicable. A co-relation of data concerning the material culture, spatial organization and ritual context will be used to identify elements which determine the deceased’s identity at the basic level (sex, age, time of burial) and at the level of the community (status and role). By comparing data on different communities we will check if there is a specific group of elements that sets apart some communities within a cultural group, and whether there are links between communities which define the identity of certain cultural groups. The result will consist of a set of identification markers, which will determine the identity of the deceased with respect to their basic community and/or cultural group (within the timeframe of the Iron Age). 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Early Iron Age, burial customs, identity, Hallstatt Culture, burial mounds, elites, princely burials, Alps, Pannonia|

The goal is to shed light and to interconnect different views of the problem, therefore deepening the understanding of the subject area, and offer preventive and curative solutions. This is necessary because insolvency, on business level, disables development and adequate business and financial restructuring, on personal level it destroys an individual and a family, whereas at social level it creates poverty and enhances negative economic trends. Goals are aimed at: different levels of the principal groups of insolvency and over-indebtedness actors, which are: business, personal and public level, and at business environment as a platform for finding better indebtedness management possibilities. The results of the business level research should significantly improve the prediction possibilities of financial distress and enable larger time-opportunity-window to exploit different restructuring options. Also, the results should provide the scientific knowledge of such financial management that would encourage business development by financial leverage and not threaten the survival of business entities because of the inadequate capital structure. The results of the personal level research should make way to the widespread alteration of approach to new debt. New personal finance culture pattern is expected to be backed by these results and should emerge both among individuals (as demand force of debt), and financial institutions (as supply force of debt). Project proposal is directed toward the research of four distinctive segments of business environment, predominantly of political – legal or economic origin: personal insolvency regulation, business insolvency regulation, monetary and fiscal possibilities in overcoming excessive indebtedness, and banks and financial industry in generating anticipative consumption causing excessive indebtedness. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Business Insolvency, Personal Insolvency, Indebtedness, Bankruptcy Law, Restructuring|

Addressing the novel questions outlined in this proposal will enrich our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing cerebral blood flow in conditions of severe hypoxia. Characterization of these relationships between oxygen, cerebral perfusion and cerebral metabolism, and their respective importance on brain homeostasis is a fundamental step toward raising our understanding of brain physiology to that of other body systems. Breath holding exerts a potent stress to the cardiovascular system and brain, yet elite breath-hold divers are able to tolerate marked reductions in blood oxygenation that only sometimes results in loss of consciousness (syncope). The mechanisms allowing such tolerance to hypoxemic extremes may serve as a useful model for the study of cerebrovascular regulation during physiological duress often observed in trauma and disease. This is especially true given that the study of regional brain perfusion during cardiorespiratory challenges, exercise, and in pathology has only begun in the past several years. Thus, the study of regional cerebrovascular regulation and its relation to the circulatory and ventilatory in healthy, trained breath-hold divers will yield new insight into the cerebrovascular function and systems integration in humans. Moreover, elucidation of these mechanistic relationships is paramount to our comprehension of myriad pathologies associated with arterial hypoxemia and/or elevations in blood viscosity or hemoglobin levels. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolism, hypoxia, hyperoxia, hypercapnia, hypocapnia|

After the outset of the recent economic crisis, fiscal devaluations have become priority topic in economic policy discussions in Europe. These discussions are mostly related to European Monetary Union member states, but the topic is highly relevant for a broader set of countries, including those which may be outside currency unions, but pursue fixed exchange rate policy (e.g. Croatia). There are, however, significant gaps in the scientific research of fiscal devaluations. The largest part of related contributions consists of simulation studies, whose results are driven by model specifications and calibrations. The econometric studies, on the other hand, which could provide answers on the effectiveness and channels of fiscal devaluations in practice, remain very scarce. The proposed research aims to fill some of the gaps in the literature, by providing new econometric evidence in an improved econometric approach to testing the hypothesis of the fiscal devaluation effectiveness, and by examining the relevance of some of the specific channels through which fiscal devaluations should work. The proposed research is divided into four segments: 1) Testing the effectiveness of fiscal devaluations in the EU using bilateral trade data; 2) Testing the impact of fiscal devaluation on real exchange rates; 3) Testing whether the effects of fiscal devaluations vary for industries with different labor intensity in production; 4) Testing the impact of cuts in social security contributions (and overall tax burden on labor) on wages. Our sample will include all EU countries for which data is available. We shall also consider the period of the recent crisis during which many EU countries implemented reforms of taxation systems. 					 				|	|Economy|	|fiscal policy, exports, competitiveness, taxation, European Union|

This structure develops gradually from the earliest stages of infection and involves stepwise reorganization of membrane organelles. Although the final structure is relatively well characterized during human cytomegalovirus infection, the sequence of events that leads to the development of the AC is poorly understood. The goal of this project is to characterize processes proceeding to the formation of the AC in cells infected with murine CMV (MCMV). MCMV starts with remodeling of the endosomal system very early in the infection, which we characterized as development of the early-phase endosomal retention compartment (EPERC). There is strong indication that the EPERC is predecessor of AC. It is generally accepted that endosomal remodeling is driven by small GTPases from the Rab and Arf family and phosphoinositides (PI). In the proposed project, we plan to reveal sequence of membranous organelle reorganization events in the early phase of infection that presumably lead to the formation of the AC. With that purpose, we will determine the role of small GTPases of the Rab and Arf family and their effector proteins in membrane organelle perturbation events during the early phase of MCMV infection. Finally, we plan to characterize membrane domains of the EPERC during the entire early phase regarding PI content, which include the study of PI effectors and major enzymes that drive PI conversion and thereby change membrane identity. To achieve these goals, we will use triple immunofluorescence staining of EPERC, genetically engineered fluorescent probes, RNA silencing and pharmacological inhibitors. Outcome of the proposed research will be a reconstruction of the mechanism of development of the EPERC and identification of cellular proteins that are targeted by MCMV in the early phase of infection. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Cytomegalovirus, endosomes, endosomal remodeling, virion assembly, phosphoinositides|

Several forms are classified in clinical practice, depending on the main pathogenic mechanism: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used mouse model of RA and is still an indispensible tool to study the disease pathogenesis. Through the production of osteoresorptive mediators by immune cells, chronic inflammation in arthritis creates a microenvironment that promotes osteoresorption by osteoclasts (OC). OCs are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells arising from myeloid hematopoietic lineage. A number of systemic and local stimuli, such as hormones and cytokines/chemokines, promote osteoclastogenesis by enhancing OC differentiation, migration, activation, lifespan and function, but the exact mechanisms of how the inflammatory network works in vivo in the context of arthritis are largely unclear. Particularly, the human osteoclast progenitor (OCP) populations are not precisely defined and it is, as yet, unknown which critical mediators have the potential to activate OCPs and attract them to produce joint lesions. Using the mouse model of CIA and samples from arthritic patients we propose to elucidate differentiation sequence of early progenitors into mature OCs, shifts in the frequency of discrete OCP subpopulations and their migration patterns during arthritis. We plan to identify distinct OCP subpopulations in the bone marrow, periphery and joint lesions, their migratory and homing patterns, and their functional links to bone loss in arthritis. We expect to define the properties of inflammatory microenvironment in the regulation of OC trafficking, differentiation and activity in arthritis. A better characterization of arthritis-induced OCP subpopulations could offer the potential to design therapeutic approaches to control their migration and curtail their osteoresorptive potential. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|osteoclasts, arthritis, inflammation, progenitors, differentiation, cytokines, chemokines|

Despite extensive body of research invested in these processes, various modes of charge transfer and dependence thereof upon the reaction conditions are still insufficiently understood. By a synergistic combination of experimental and computational approaches, we hope to make major advances in understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of charge transfer in free radical reactions in aqueous media, particularly of the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Our focus will be on the reactions of the a-hydroxyalkyl and a-aminoalkyl radicals with halogenated organic substrates, and how the product yields of such a radical-induced dehalogenation are influenced by several buffer systems. In the similar context, we also plan to study reductive properties of the hydrogen atom, which offers a fascinating prospect of exploring the PCET process at its most fundamental. The reactions will be incited by the g-radiolysis of buffered aqueous solutions, followed by the detection and quantitative measurement of the products. This will be accompanied by quantum-chemical and molecular dynamical calculations, both to help rationalize the experimental findings and to guide the experiments. Because the PCET in these systems is remarkably accompanied by a chain reaction that greatly enhances the dehalogenation yields, we intend to elucidate the favorable conditions for the PCET to occur, especially as opposed to the rival free radical substitution and addition. A successful accomplishment of the objectives will be instrumental for resolution of the central problem in the aqueous chemistry of free radicals, and that is how to rationally design the specific reaction conditions, e.g. pH, reactant and buffer concentrations, in order to steer a free-radical induced reaction and optimize the yield due to a desired reaction channel. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Radiation chemistry, Quantum chemistry, Molecular dynamics, Reaction Mechanism, Kinetics, Aqueous solution, Proton-coupled electron transfer|

The proposal addresses a fast-developing area of liquid crystal science in which bulk, helical arrangements are formed from constituents, which are not themselves chiral. The current proposal arises from previous work in which it was shown that flexibly linked, dimeric molecules may also exhibit this general behaviour. According to the theoretical model, the arrangement does not require molecular chirality, instead it can be facilitated simply by the shape of bent molecules. Among great number of studied dimers, only a few achiral odd-memebered dimeric molecules displayed an unusual nematic phase with helical molecular organization. Such an observation is unprecedented and the current proposal seeks to delineate the central structure/property correlations and expand the number of such materials available. The work proposed herein envisages synthesis and mesomorphic characterisation a range of novel symmetric dimers having modifications on all relevant structural moieties in order to unravel their role in molecular arrangement within the liquid crystalline state. Conformational analysis using DFT calculation will provide information on geometrical and electronic effects influencing molecular packing while NMR investigation of selected neat dimers will enable direct insight into intermolecular interactions within the phase. Thus, combined experimental, computational and spectroscopic studies will provide valuable information on structural and electronic factors influencing formation and stability of helical self-assembly and expands the possibility for controlled fabrication of novel materials for various applications ranging from micropower generators to artificial muscle. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|dimers, liquid crystals, chiral self-assembly, conformational analysis, NMR|

Purification and analysis methods will be focused on measles virus, snake venom and antivenom proteins, and human plasma proteins. Measles virus is used as a vaccine and is found very suitable as a gene vector and as an oncolytic virotherapeutic, with the last two applications requiring large amounts of the virus. Venom is an antigen for antivenom production and both require careful analysis in order to obtain the final product of high quality. Proteins from plasma, namely albumin and immunoglobulin, are of great medical importance and their purification and stability are of utmost significance. All these biomolecules are important as biotechnological products and are subjected to rigorous quality requirements to ensure their safe usage. Therefore, non-invasive purification methods upgrading their quality and sustainable production and ensuring stability of these fragile biomolecules are essential. This project will base purification on chromatography using monolith stationary phases which are featured by their suitability for biomolecules due to high porosity, high binding capacity and convective based transport. Ion-exchange and affinity chromatography will be employed and various conditions tested for obtaining target material with high purity and yield. Also, various formulation conditions enabling preservation of virus viability and protein functionality and stability throughout the process will be tested. The analysis of the virus infectivity and protein functionality, removal of contaminants and the overall procedure effectiveness will be done by classical biochemical and virological methods as well as by some novel methods such as nanoparticle analysis that enables detection of virus and protein aggregates (NanoSight). 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|chromatography, viruses, plasma proteins, snake venom, monoliths, bioanalytics, aggregation|

The foci of URBES project are selected medieval Slavonian towns (Gradec and Varaždin) and selected Eastern Adriatic towns, from Istrian communes in the north to Dubrovnik in the south. This project examines High and Late Middle Ages (thirteenth to mid-sixteenth centuries). The main hypothesis of the URBES project is that the elites were central to urban developments. The goal of the URBES project is to provide answers to questions such as: What was the role of the urban estates (with regard to its size, location and continuity) in the formation of medieval elites? How did urban elites in chosen towns of Croatian Middle Ages transform in relation to urban space? What was their influence upon the urban space, and their presence in the urban space? On the basis of the rich extant databases, the project will reconstruct and analyse dense matrix of families, households, properties and buildings in chosen towns, and trace their evolution over time, gaining new insights into social structures and urban space. Although the cities of the Croatian Middle Ages are in the centre of URBES, the project will focus on the issues that go beyond the scale of individual towns in order to make comparisons of similar phenomena between cities and towns in a broader geographical and political context, and to trace residential mobility of the urban elites. Also, the project proposes the interdisciplinary approach, with the use of relevant IT possibilities. 					 				|	|History|	|urban elites, urban space, Croatian Middle Ages, cities, prosopography, social topography|

It proposes a complex research outline based dominantly on qualitative methodology, aiming at untangling and comprehending multiple, multilayered and interdependent (f)actors and processes that influence contemporary transformations in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. The concept of city-making in this research refers to a comprehensive construction and articulation of urban life along two axes—space and diversity. Both constitute nodes at which global political, economic and cultural flows meet and collide with local histories, way of life, imaginaries, interests and developments, bringing about the restructuring of the city and its identity as well as identities of city inhabitants. This ethnological and cultural anthropological project emphasises agency of city dwellers in these transformations and investigates how they negotiate and re-create the given social, cultural, and spatial landscape (cityscape) investing it with meaning and humanising it. The project will have an important bearing on the city's politics and policies, with the goal of achieving more sustainable and inclusive functioning of the city while, at the same time, it will advance the state of the art of urban studies. In addition, it will ensure the transfer of knowledge via university courses and public presentations aimed at raising the awareness about various urban issues (planning, environment, representation, cultural production, diversity, marginality etc.). 					 				|	|Ethnology and anthropology|	|urban anthropology, city, everyday life and culture, politics of space, politics of difference, urban identities, anthropology of migration|

First, the team will analyse the question of the influence of the existing civil law system to the aggravation of the financial difficulties of citizens. Second, the team will analyse the question of potentials of the civil law system for remedying these difficulties and for preventing them in the future. The team shall focus on five objectives: 1. researching the legal model of pre-contractual obligations of traders to inform citizens of their contractual rights and obligations, 2. researching the legal model of responsible lending, 3. researching the model for the protection of citizens in case of a deterioration of the financial situation after agreeing to and/or defaulting on a monetary obligation, 4.researching alternative models of voluntary performance of monetary obligations, and 5. researching the models of civil law protection of citizens in debt collection. The aim of the project is to find optimum measures, both of regulatory and non-regulatory nature, which are necessary to be implemented in order to improve unfortunate financial position of citizens. The research is projected to be undertaken in four consecutive stages or “work packages” (WP’s) in total duration of three years. WP 1 consists of the analysis of the legislation, theory and case law in the field of civil law which has an impact of the current financial crisis of citizens. WP 2 consists of empirical survey. WP 3 consists of the development of recommendations of measures of regulatory and non-regulatory nature which should be implemented in order to improve the existing legal, economic and social environment to the benefit of citizens.

The core methodology consists in conducting philosophical investigations that are aimed at offering practical recommendations and that are constrained by knowledge of the practical setting of Croatian mental health law and care. Two central philosophical issues appear to be relevant to the philosophical investigation and, thus, addressing them is the aim of the project. First, a significant part of the contemporary debate on the social response to antisocial personality disorder centers on this notion. Some have argued that this notion involves normative preconceptions against the liberties of certain individuals. Others have questioned the accuracy and scientific robustness of the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorders and its precision of related risk predictions. Second, the justification for choosing the appropriate treatment for people with antisocial personality disorder must also be a moral one. In particular, a relevant type of moral justification has to be grounded in principles that correlate psychological descriptions and explanations of a person’s behavior with his or her degree of responsibility. Similarly, compulsory treatment appears to be conditional upon a person’s diminished responsibility or capacity to act accordingly to a treatment decision, together with the existence of a risk to themselves or to others. The philosophical investigation of the project will be integrated with the contributions of a leading forensic psychiatrist in Croatia, a sociological qualitative analysis of the practices and challenges that are encountered by institutional representatives in the forensic department of the Rab psychiatric hospital and an historical investigation of the institutional response to antisocial personality disorder in the region in the period 1918-1980. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|antisocial personality disorders, psychiatric classification, psychiatric explanation, moral responsibility, Croatian mental health law and care|

Particular attention will be paid to the analysis of drought, floods and heat waves. Possible change in climate suitability for tourism will be investigated. The obtained gridded fields will become a reference data for the validation of climate models and an input into the flash-flood warning systems. Current and future climate of the Mediterranean area will be examined by analyzing the results of global-model simulations and by using the statistical and dynamical downscaling approach. Simulations by RegCM4.2 regional climate model will be performed at the horizontal resolution of 12.5 km. Also planned is to utilize results from experiments based on coupled atmosphere-ocean models from the currently running Med-CORDEX project with a purpose of analyzing the contribution of oceanic component in the simulations over the Adriatic Sea and the surrounding land area. Trends and interdecadal variability of sea level in the Mediterranean sub-basins will be identified and contributions of the governing processes will be assessed. Coastal flooding in the Northern Adriatic and time evolution in occurrence of extreme sea levels in the context of mean-sea-level rise will be considered. Finally, older variants of semi-empirical method of projecting global sea level will be compared with the more general method recently developed. It is expected that the project thus considered will meet the three important criteria (relevance, reliability, feasibility), by addressing one of the few priorities put forward by the European Union in its growth strategy Europe 2020, by relying on the state-of-the-art methods of data analysis and modeling, and by involving a majority of researchers engaged in the study of climate-related physical processes in Croatia. 					 				|	|Geophysics|	|Adriatic, climate change, extremes, climate models, downscaling, spatial interpolation, sea-level trend, coastal flooding, sea-level projections|

Compensation is a key element of the employment relationship and, in addition to being the single greatest operating cost for many organizations, it has been advocated as a tool for enhancing organizational performance and sustained competitiveness. Due to high impact of compensation management on overall firm performance, we recognized the need to research it in detail within Croatian companies. Furthermore, since Croatian companies constitute just a part of the larger European Union (EU) market in which mobility and free movement of persons is guaranteed we thus find that compensation management strategies and practices used by Croatian companies must be competitive within larger EU context. This research is aimed at making comparative research of Croatian and EU countries’ compensation strategies and practices in order to develop knowledge on the topic, all with the purpose of developing compensation strategies that would allow Croatian companies to increase their relative competitiveness and reduce excessive employee drain to foreign labour markets. Besides scientific dissemination, research findings would allow developing recommendations for Croatian companies how to use state-of-the art compensation practices applied to Croatian context and would be used as inputs in developing education programs for compensation specialists. Comparative studies exploring such gap and its implications are non-existent. This study should therefore represent an early and exploratory approach toward developing this field. 					 				|	|Economy|	|compensation management, compensation strategy, reward system, pay, benefits,|

Beside linear codes over finite fields and finite rings, we will also investigate quantum codes and network codes. In fact, the links and connections between codes and combinatorial structures are the main focus and emphasis of the proposed project. For constructions of the combinatorial structures and codes we will mainly use algebraic, geometric and enumerative techniques, as well as computational methods. When dealing with combinatorial structures, these include in particular constructions from finite groups and constructions using orbit matrices. The very general Kramer-Mesner method will be implemented and combined with other methods like that of tactical decompositions. Codes will be constructed directly from the obtained combinatorial structures, and vice versa. Our research in scope of this project will also include constructions of Hadamard matrices and related designs and codes. All gotten structures will be analyzed in terms of their automorphism groups and other structural (geometric, algebraic) properties. Obtained codes, designs and graphs will be compared with the previously known structures. As a result of the proposed research, we expect constructions of codes with good properties, possibly better than the presently known codes, and constructions and classifications of various combinatorial structures. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|code, network coding, t-design, q-ary design, graph, strongly regular graph, finite group|

Despite intensive experimental studies of physiological Cu(aa)2 during the last 40 years, their exact structures in solutions generally remain unresolved. Our density functional theory (DFT) study of bis(L-histidinato)copper(II) (Eur J Inorg Chem 2014: 198) is the first that clarified the structure of that physiological compound in aqueous solution at physiological conditions. Based on our previous studies, the main goal of the project is to obtain new results on the physico-chemical properties (structure, energy, vibrations, cis-trans isomerism, conformational changes) in different surroundings (vacuum, aqueous solution, solid state) of selected Cu(aa)2 because of their biological importance and stereochemical diversity by using the molecular modelling (DFT, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics) and experimental (X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR) methods. By combining these methods we expect to contribute to solving yet unresolved issues of (1) the exact geometries in solution and solid state, (2) the processes occurring at the molecular level. The new results will contribute to understanding the data required in the discovery of new potential drugs since the detailed physico-chemical characterisation is a necessary first step in the drug development. It is worth mentioning that the interest in copper coordination complex research as antiproliferative agents has markedly increased in the last few years. We expect our results to have an impact on applications in bioinorganic chemistry, biophysics, biology, and medicine. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|copper, amino acids, molecular modelling, DFT, MM, MD, X-ray structure analysis, solid-state NMR, cis-trans isomerism, physiological compounds|

They have a unique life-style inhabiting plant phloem and insect cells and needing both hosts for survival in nature. Their genomes are repeat-rich yet relatively small and reduced missing many basic metabolic pathways. Phytoplasma axenic cultivation is still challenging. Nevertheless, 4 phytoplasma genomes have been sequenced and annotated with several genome drafts also available. However, the understanding of all mechanisms underlying phytoplasma pathogenicity is far from complete. First molecular evidence for the phytoplasma presence in Croatia has been given in late 1990’s on grapevine. Since then, the number of discovered phytoplasma species, insect vectors and affected plant hosts is rising with grapevine and fruit trees’ phytoplasma pathosystems being well characterized. The main objective of this project would be sequencing of ‘Ca. P. solani’, the most widespread phytoplasma in Croatia, with generation and comparative analysis of genome draft or fully assembled genome. Obtained results would give new data on candidate virulence effectors and other factors involved in interactions with hosts and adaptation to different environments. Another goal would be genotyping of new and already available isolates by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of house-keeping and specific variable genes. New genotyping tools for improved diagnostics and molecular epidemiology studies with implications in risk assessment would also be developed. Functional studies would focus on surface variable membrane proteins involved in interactions with insect hosts and transmissibility. Moreover, this would be the first sequencing project of a bacterial plant pathogen genome in Croatia. The establishment of this project would open a new field of molecular plant pathology and genomics in Croatian science. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|bacteria, epidemiology, diagnostics, pathogenicity, phylogenomics|

Such simplified approach often underestimates the ecotoxicological relevance of a contaminant class, either by neglecting the contribution of its transformation products or by overlooking some critical mechanisms that may pose a threat to the environmental safety and human health. As opposed to that, this project aims at demonstrating the importance of the comprehensive assessment of aquatic contaminants, based on the study of two important groups of pharmaceuticals, macrolide antibiotics (MAs) and opioid analgesics (OAs), by including their main transformation products (TPs) and addressing the issue of physico-chemical partitioning in the exposure assessment. The project work plan envisages development of class-specific methods for the concurrent quantitative analysis of the target contaminants and their known TPs using liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), while identification of unknown TPs will be performed using LC coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry employing time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. The transformation processes of selected contaminant classes will be systematically studied in laboratory-controlled conditions with a special emphasis on biotransformation and ozonation. The biotransformation experiments will be performed using well-characterised mixed microbial communities isolated from contaminated natural habitats. The transformation studies will encompass the determination of dissipation kinetics of the parent compounds as well as identification of TPs. Ecotoxicological importance of the transformation processes will be evaluated using a combination of exposure-driven and effect-driven approaches. Finally, the project envisages verification of the relative importance of TPs in real systems, including wastewater treatment plants and ambient surface waters. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|macrolide antimicrobials, opioid analgesics, transformation products, degradation, ozonization, biological effects, wastewaters|

However, the detailed understanding of its impact on a given process is poorly understood. Direct investigation of this phenomenon by experimental means, is a challenging endeavour, as the microscopic details are frequently hidden from macroscopic observations. Computational simulations, on the other hand, provide detailed information regarding molecular dynamics and flexibility. The theoretical approach is thus crucial in both understanding the experimental results and in expanding the underlying conceptual framework. The present project proposes to utilize state-of-the-art computational techniques to address the importance of molecular flexibility across a range of carefully selected examples from the life sciences. The examples, which can be classified under the headings: (i) peptides and spectroscopy, (ii) protein flexibility, and (iii) enzyme related transformations, have been chosen to span multiple time and length scales and thus to highlight the diverse and wide-reaching nature of molecular flexibility. The selected examples exhibit a significant degree complementarity and synergy with one another and are all associated with their own applicative importance in different areas of (bio)chemistry. In addition to the scientific research proposed, the project aims to consolidate a highly successful and competitive platform in computational life sciences that has been established at the RBI. This platform was already recognized through the granting of an EU-FP6 project (2007-2010).

This information is crucial for the sustainable, scientific management of coastal ecosystems, as required by EU instruments such as the Habitats Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Water Framework Directive, and the Common Fisheries Policy. The major questions asked are 1) What are the ecological baselines in Croatia in community structure? 2) How does anthropogenic activity (harvesting, coastal development) shift community structure from baseline? 3) How do marine protected areas maintain functional communities? 4) How is community structure changing over time? We will investigate these questions using innovative, non-destructive techniques for quantifying fish abundance and size distribution, and benthic habitat quality. These techniques include lure-assisted, underwater visual census which was originally developed in the Schultz laboratory; baited, underwater video; and DGPS-assisted, towed underwater video. EU policies require that non-destructive methods for assessment and monitoring replace destructive harvest-based methods currently in widespread use, and these methods are among the most scientifically supported non-destructive methods currently available. These methods will be used to quantify fish community structure and benthic habitat at all major MPAs and former MPAs in Croatia, to compare communities within MPAs to matched locations outside MPAs. Matched locations will be chosen to test for specific anthropogenic drivers of community structure, such as high fishing pressure, coastal development, marine tourism, aquaculture, and terrestrial runoff. These results will advance our basic understanding of coastal ecosystems, and will be crucial for satisfying Croatia's responsibilities as an EU citizen in MPA construction, management, and monitoring of marine resources. 					 				|	|Biology|	|community ecology, fish, Posidonia, habitat, monitoring|

The basic idea underlying the project stems from an apparent disparity between the rather advanced extensions of the traditional linear finite-element principles to non-linear problems and the fact that the key finite-element concept – that of interpolation of the unknown functions – is surprisingly kept mostly constant, i.e. configuration-independent. Enabling the finite-element approximation to become configuration-dependent is motivated by the existing need to improve the current non-linear finite-element procedures, in particular for mechanical problems defined on non-linear manifolds. This principle is presented as the general concept providing viable novel development paradigm with obvious benefits for a wider class of mechanical problems. The configuration-dependent approximation to be designed shall obey the essential convergence requirements, with its extra flexibility (arising from the potential of the new approximation to vary with the configuration) employed to improve the solution in some clearly defined manner. In particular, during the design process, the following two basic principles will be consistently adhered to: (i) In the limiting case where the non-linear mechanical problem becomes linear, the configuration-dependent approximation sought must coincide with a known reference interpolation for linear analysis. (ii) In a general non-linear situation, the configuration-dependent approximation should preserve a set of selected mechanical or mathematical properties of equilibrium or motion defined beforehand. In this way, a variety of finite-elements for static and dynamic analysis will be derived. 					 				|	|Basic engineering sciences|	|non-linear structural analysis, finite-element method, configuration-dependent approximation, beams, shells, dynamics|

Natural forests make up 95% of the total forests in Croatia and in its wealth geographic region contains different ecological types and a large number of the forest tree species. Global climate changes, rising temperatures, falling rainfall, occurrence of the extreme weather events directly affect on genetic diversity. The main objective of the proposed project is to make recommendations for the conservation of the genetic diversity of the forest trees. Precondition for achieving the goal is the identification and understanding of the genetic variability of the individual tree species. The research to be carried out by the project would be based on the common oak and beech. On existing genetic tests that were established at different sites, data on the survival and growth of plants, phenology, silvicultural properties, plant resistance to pests, etc should be collect. The stem forest stands from which the seed was taken will be used for collecting the data of health condition, fruiting and climatic parameters. The genetic diversity of the provenance will be analyzed by DNA markers. This project should be continued and expanded research on the identification of proven European beech resistant to drought, which are conducted in the framework of a bilateral cooperation with Germany (MSES-DAAD 2013/14) and the preservation of the gene pool and study of the variability of our most important tree species which are conducted as part of the project “Breeding and forest seed” supported by MSES of Croatia. From the economic point of view, the project aims is to raise the category of the forest reproductive material (FRM) in a higher category according to the Law of FRM (Official Gazette 75/2009, 61 /2011 - EU directive EC/105/99). Higher category guarantees a higher quality, and thus a higher price in the market. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|Genetic conservation, Climate changes, Forest , provenance trials, variability, Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica|

Such artisan products are increasingly appreciated because of their authenticity although of great consideration due to their variable microbiological and organoleptic quality. Overall monitoring of wildlife reservoir is needed in assessment its potential as sources for zoonosis agents exposures of humans as well as sources of bacterial strains relevant for enhancement and standardization of game meat sausages production. There are large variations in prevalence of microbial populations of game meat even within a single country and the published data for Croatia is limited and poorly documented which does not allow any related analysis. Especially the data on risk -based monitoring of zoonosis and antibiotic resistance genes transmission via game meat food chain in Croatia is missing and there is not authentic collection of indigenous bacterial strains that could act as a pool of novel genes and metabolic pathways relevant for high quality food production. MiCROgame focuses on the in situ diversity analysis as well as detailed characterization of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Croatian game meat sausages. Application of this autochthonous microbiota into the sausages production can influence the end-product quality and can accelerate maturation such helping producers to be more competitive on national or EU market. Special focus will be set towards identification and characterization of potential spoilage and pathogenic microflora and antibiotic resistance traits in order to estimate safety of locally produced game meat food and to identify sources of contamination. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|traditional game meat sausages, lactic acid bacteria, foodborn pathogens, antibiotic resistance, starter cultures|

Examples of such systems include the so-called smart structures composed of a large number of sensors and actuators mounted on constructive elements (beams/plates) with the goal to damp undesired vibrations or to control flow of fluids; adaptive optics with large amount of optical elements; smart electrical power systems; highways with automated cars driving in platoons. Common characteristic of all of the above mentioned systems is that they are composed of a large number of spatially distributed dynamical subsystems which operate under constant mutual interactions through some physical interconnections (network) and/or communication links (network). Today, it is widely acknowledged that the key challenge in development of such dynamical networks is synthesis of algorithms for their control. The main goal of this project is development of some of the key elements in fundamental theory of control for spatially distributed systems, together with constructive controller synthesis algorithms suitable for application in real-life problems. The research focus will be on distributed control solutions in which each dynamical system in the network is controlled by its local controller and each local controller communicates and coordinates its actions with a (usually small) set of directly neighboring controllers. Our approach will be based on innovative elements from the theory of dissipative systems, while both spatially invariant networks and generic dynamical networks with arbitrary interconnection graph will be considered. The developed control algorithms will be verified in laboratory experiments on groups of mobile robots and on a distributed vibration control platform. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|control systems, distributed control, optimization, large-scale systems, vibrations|

Thereby the requirements on dynamic functioning of these systems can be achieved by different system interactions, whereas some of them are more preferable than the others from the standpoints of energy consumption or other criteria like price of operation or equivalent pollution. The global objective of the project 3CON is to research and develop optimal control techniques on significantly different large consumers – building systems and railway traffic systems – in conceptually identical way: by applying the principle of hierarchical decomposition of systems and cooperative optimal controls between the hierarchy levels. In that way the computed energy consumption profile on the lower level directly maximizes the global economic gain of the system operation in the presence of system constraints (e.g. allowed temperatures or fixed train travelling time). This will enable the proactive role of these largest consumers in energy grids of the future (smart grids). It will make them responsive and in position to best exploit the imposed varying energy exchange terms. Thereby vast possibilities in energy grid management through dynamic pricing will be opened – foremost for reducing losses between generation and consumption points in the grid and increasing grid reliability. The secondary global objective of this installation grant is to build an internationally competent research group in control of energy-intensive systems on the Faculty which is also recognized and accepted by relevant domestic companies. The project developments will be verified through building and railway traffic case studies that will be supervised by relevant Croatian companies. This will ensure that all relevant system issues are taken care of in the design and that the design itself is close to exploitation. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|optimal control, hierarchical control, building, railway traffic system, energy consumption, power flow optimisation, prosumer, smart grid|

Common methods applied to make use of biomass energy potential are biochemical and thermochemical conversion methods. Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical process carried out in the absence of oxygen that yields with three different end-products – bio-oil, biochar and syngas. Pyrolysis of agricultural residues can help meet renewable energy targets by displacing fossil fuels and, thereby, deal with concerns regarding the global warming. Unlike direct combustion, pyrolysis yields with more end-products. Bio-oil has environmental benefits as a clean fuel and causes less pollution as compared to fossil fuels, whereas biochar can be put on soil and act as a carbon-sequestering and climate-mitigating agent. Based on the above-mentioned, the overall objective of this project is to determine the potential of different types of biomass residues and waste, and dedicated crops, for bio-oil and biochar production via pyrolysis. Since the type of feedstock significantly influences the pyrolysis process and the yield of end-products, the specific objective of the proposed project will be to determine the potential of pyrolysis from different biomass feedstock collected in two climatically different regions, Mediterranean and Continental Croatia. Project will be split into three main phases, including feedstock collection and characterization, biomass pyrolysis, and end-products' (bio-oil and biochar) characterization. This will provide the most detailed database so far, speaking worldwide, and should result with the information on the optimum feedstock, concerning the available biomass in relation to the region. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|waste agricultural biomass, dedicated crops, conversion, pyrolysis, energy, added value products, bio-oil, biochar|

Driven by requirements such as scalability, flexibility, and administration, there is an increasing trend in migrating applications to the cloud. A key concern and differentiator between providers is meeting end users’ requirements in terms of service quality and expectations, referred to as Quality of Experience (QoE). The Q-MANIC project will propose a cooperative QoE management scheme exploiting new QoE knowledge and business models based on cooperative efforts between cloud/service providers and mobile network operators to achieve more efficient management of network/system resources, while enhancing end user QoE. Novel approaches for coordination and information exchange among actors involved in the service delivery chain will be proposed beyond those available in today's networks. Resource allocation and service adaptation algorithms will be proposed targeting different optimization strategies and taking into account multiple stakeholder perspectives. To demonstrate the benefits and applicability of the proposed approach, we address two use cases involving interactive, bandwidth intensive cloud-based applications delivered via mobile networks (LTE/LTE-advanced/5G): mobile cloud gaming and mobile multi-party video chat. We will rely on empirically obtained data to specify QoE models and optimal service adaptation strategies. The QoE management scheme will combine network management mechanisms and application adaptation strategies to bring improvements in QoE and efficiency of resource usage. A key contribution will be the incorporation of contextual knowledge and analysis of user behaviour and interactions into building validated QoE models that will be exploited in the context of QoE management. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|Quality of Experience, QoE modelling, multimedia applications, cloud, QoE management|

Climate change evokes new demands for successful wheat breeding such as adaptability to various abiotic stress factors. The most important traits that are affected with climate changes such as drought are yield and quality. Drought tolerance in wheat is quantitative trait with very complex phenotype and genetic control. Significant number of wheat traits has different influence level on drought tolerance. Current global research trend is directed toward development of functional markers linked with wheat adaptability traits. Functional markers are derived from polymorphic sites within the gene that are directly associated with phenotypic variation. Proposed project includes total of 364 wheat accessions originated from five continents. Aims of the project are: assessment of phenotypic and molecular genetic diversity of wheat breeding germplasm; identification of existing functional markers for agronomical important traits in tested germplasm; identification of marker-trait associations; outlining the most suitable parents for future crossing and breeding programs. Project will include phenotyping of traits that are linked with wheat adaptability to drought. This project will contribute to improvement of knowledge of wheat genome research and detection of candidate genes for major marker-traits associations. Knowledge gained through this project will be helpful to better understand genetic control of wheat traits important for adaptation to climate change and drought tolerance. Project will bring out new skills to research group and to research institutions in Croatia by utilisation of DArT markers on wheat for the first time in Croatia. Project will also contribute to wheat selection – research will point out best parents for crossing and it will enable development of new wheat breeding population for further selection and research. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|wheat, adaptability, phenotyping, SSR, DArT, association mapping, candidate genes|

In the Cretaceous period, especially at the Early and Late Cretaceous time boundary, significant echoes of large-scale geodynamic process(es) have been identified in the geological record within crystalline basement rocks, as well as in clastic synorogenic sediments, and even on the previously very stable carbonate platform. Meticulous investigation and recognition of the characteristics of crystalline rocks of different Cretaceous ages, origin and occurrence, along with the investigation of numerous distinct clastic formations belonging to successive basins from different tectonic environments will reveal the presently obscured interrelations among igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary processes and tectonic events. These events are the result of interdependent evolutionary dynamics of large tectonic units belonging to the investigated area during Cretaceous. The obtained data will be complemented by analysis of the facies variability recorded within the Upper Cretaceous successions of the Karst Dinarides. The proposed project will be conducted by parallel field work, cabinet and laboratory research and performed through up-to-date methods and investigation procedures of three partly overlapping and continuously interacting working groups devoted to crystalline basement research, sedimentary research of neighboring clastic basins, and the study of variable penecontemporaneous environments of the carbonate platform realm. The collected data will considerably contribute to the reconstruction of the geodynamic evolution of the Dinaridic-Alpine-Pannonian realm as a whole. As such, the results revealed by the complex, multidisciplinary insight would be of general interest for those dealing with the geological history of Alpine Europe and the present Dinaridic-Alpine-Pannonian realm. 					 				|	|Geology|	|Cretaceous, geodynamics, processes, Dinarides, Pannonian Basin|

Research will comprise topics relating to (mis)use of art for or against political regimes, artistic heritage of marginalized groups, the concept of unwanted heritage and institutional construction of art discourses and their reception. Understanding sociopolitical background can contribute to greater understanding of heritage-based conflicts, while indications of the transnational nature of Central European art can encourage its protection and ensure its sustainability.

Its prevalence is more than 30% in the general Croatian population, with especially high rate on Croatian islands, up to 58%. Specific features of the Eastern Adriatic Islands (EAI) (genetic isolates with high level of inbreeding, mixing traditional and transitional lifestyle and continuous depopulation processes) represent a basis for development of specific MetS risk factor patterns. This project is a pilot study with the aims to: assess the prevalence of known risk factors (biological, environmental and behavioral) for the MetS in EAI and nearby mainland area of the targeted Croatian populations and to use this information as a base to develop an intervention strategy. Population-based pregnancy and birth cohort studies are particularly salient for studying early origins of health and disease that begin in fetal life and infancy. A longitudinal approach will be used on a representative sample of 713 participants in each group: pregnant women and children in the targeted populations of the islands (Hvar, Brač and Vis) and nearby mainland area of of the Split-Dalmatia County. The outcome of the project is revealing sets of relevant risk factors for the development of MetS in the studied Croatian populations. The long-term outcome is progressive development of a base for an effective intervention strategy, directed at relevant risk factors for MetS. The importance of this pilot study is developing foundations for a better focused population adjusted model of early intervention in the future.

The improvement of prosecution will occur as regards: a) cooperation with the EU member states, b) regional cooperation. The advancement of Croatian legal scientific research will be realized through scientific activities of research group composed of senior and young researchers from three Croatian universities specialised in the field of EU, international and regional cooperation in criminal matters. Cooperation in the prosecution of war crimes has been a crucial political and legal issue in Croatia in the past two decades. Presently the focus is moved to cooperation with the EU member states. As judicial proceedings before the ICTY were unsustainable without criminal law cooperation of the States, the effective national criminal prosecution today is as well possible only through realization of full and intensive judicial cooperation with the EU member states. Effective cooperation in the prosecution of serious crimes has multiple political and legal values for Croatia, such as credible membership in the EU, stability in the region, and the protection of human rights. It is crucial for the identification of Croatia as a democratic European state that respects the rule of law and does not tolerate any kind of serious crimes. The outcome of the research will be publication of collection of scientific papers on issues related to forms, institutions and problems of the EU and regional judicial cooperation and the level of compliance of Croatian law, judiciary and case law. The research results will be presented at the public round tables and final conference, and implemented in course curriculum at the Croatian Universities. The project will contribute to the training of six young researches and will strengthen mentoring capacities of Croatian law schools. 					 				|	|Law|	|judicial cooperation in criminal matters, european criminal law, criminal prosecution of war crimes, regional cooperation, european arrest warrant|

The goal of the project is twofold. First, to examine the degree to which well-being fluctuates over time and whether patterns of well-being fluctuations are different for different types of people. Second, we aim to examine whether well-being can be considered not only as an indicator of good life, but also as a precondition of positive outcomes and favourable life events, as proposed in the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. We posit that high levels of well-being enable the creation of later favourable life events and conditions by effective affect regulation strategies. During the four year project period, we plan to conduct on-line four-wave panel survey. Study sample will consist of adult internet users in Croatia. Through the survey, data on socio-demographic variables, personality traits, different components of well-being, affect regulation strategies and life events will be collected. Focus groups will be used as pilot tests to develop instruments. In order to recruit as many respondents as possible and to minimize attrition over the course of the consecutive waves lots of effort will be put into project promotion and advertising, as well as into informing and motivating participants to continue with the research. By following people through longer periods of time we would be able to better explain the relationships between well-being and life outcomes, as well as fluctuations in well-being. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|well-being, life events, affect regulation, personality, longitudinal study|

The international team will implement already elaborated methodologies combined with new technologies (geo-radar, remote sensing) on the medieval artistic heritage of Croatia as to track and map the changes that occurred in monumental landscape in the time span from late antiquity to the late middle ages. Croatia was a border zone between super-powers: eastern and western Roman Empire; Byzantium and respectively Lombard, Carolingian, Ottonian rule; from the 11th c. on, the powers of the West change: the Papacy and Venice, then Hungary. The ecclesiastical and social elites as protagonists of political and diplomatic activities have always strengthened their power by investing and sponsoring architecture and works of art. Those investors often commissioned works of art in their respective countries or summoned architects, sculptors and painters. The main goal of this project is to track down those artists who came from abroad as well as those going out from Croatia and to analyse the origins of the forms and functions of architecture built from late antiquity to the late middle ages. The understanding of the transformation of the Roman world in late antiquity and the early middle Ages, the need to track those changes in a longer time span, even within the growth of the medieval feudal society and to explain the role of the elites becomes fundamental. To answer those questions large field surveys will be carried on as well as the research of elites as investors and carriers of ideas, forms and functions of ecclesiastical architecture. The team is divided in working groups covering different historical regions of Croatia, submitted to very different influences during the middle ages, as well as covering different chronological sequences. By means of thorough field survey, creating catalogue data of architecture, sculpture and painting, through comparative analysis the goal will be achieved. 					 				|	|Art history|	|Late antiquity, middle ages, architecture, sculpture, painting, forms, functions, artistic transfers, historical landscape|

The applied goal of the project is to create a metaphorical language database ? the Croatian Metaphor Repository. The database will be available on the Internet. It will include the following levels: conceptual metaphors, linguistic metaphors, image schemas, cogs and frames. Metaphors will be divided by type (primary, complex and entailed metaphors), by level (general, specific), and by family (Event Structure Metaphors, Mind Metaphors, Morality Metaphors, Scalar Metaphors, Time Metaphors, Emotion Metaphors, Economics Metaphors, Governance Metaphors, Cascade Metaphors, Well-being Metaphors etc.). The theoretical background for the linguistic analysis of conceptual metaphors is the Neural Theory of Language and Thought and the Neural Theory of Metaphor. Formal annotation tools are taken from embodied construction grammar. Both theoretical research and the creation of the repository will significantly advance Croatian cognitive and computational linguistics, artificial intelligence studies and the research of language and learning processes. The database will allow for generalizations and will become a very useful tool for cross-linguistic and cross-cultural research of metaphor and thought leading to further development of the theory and the field and to understanding how people learn, understand, and use language.

Vanja Flegar, |	|We hereby submit to the HRZZ the project “Croatian philosophy and science in the European context between the 12th and 20th century” for financial support. Due to the integrative nature of the modern world, the primary issue for each member of the European and global community is the preservation of its identity, which implies cherishing national culture and the inherent philosophical and scientific tradition. Croatia’s accession to the EU has imposed an even stronger need for preservation. Research into Croatian philosophy and science started at the turn of the 20th century, but to re-examine national identity each generation inevitably has to revert to tradition, which is why studies of the works of Croatian philosophers and scientists should be our permanent mission. Continuing the work of previous researchers, our desire is to analyse the still unexplored aspects of Croatian philosophy and science in order to gain better insight into their contribution to European philosophy and science. That is why this project plans to tackle the following topics: “Reception of Plato’s philosophy in the works of Croatian philosophers between the 12th and 16th century”; “The development and shifts in Aristotelianism during the 16th and 17th century”; “The philosophy of Juraj Dragišić”; “Croatian aesthetics and poetics in the European context between the 16th and 18th century”; “The relationship between natural philosophy and alchemy in the works of Croatian authors Andrija Dudić, Pavle Skalić, and Frane Petrić”; “The alchemy in Croatia from 14th to 18th”century; “The history of Croatian chemistry during the development of natural sciences in the 19th and 20th century”; “A review of the history of Croatian philosophy in the 19th and 20th century”. The aim of this project is an anthology that would present the results of four years of research and serve as the basis for creating a comprehensive overview of the entire history of Croatian philosophy and science. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|Croatian philosophy, history of philosophy, history of science, natural sciences,aesthetics, Neo-Platonism, Aristotelianism, alchemy, postmodern|

Rural areas account for almost 90% of the land and are home to almost half of the population, both in Croatia and the EU. They are still the most important food production zones in Europe, although this primary function has been challenged by numerous modernization and globalization processes and complemented by other economic, social, cultural, and environmental functions. As a result, we have witnessed the (re)emergence of heterogeneous and diversified rural areas, juxtaposing depopulation and land abandonment in some regions, and tourist development or agricultural intensification in others. Given their size, population number, functions and variety of challenges they face, the question of future of rural areas is one of the most pressing issues in Europe today. This is evident from recent scenario-based approaches to study future trends and driving forces for rural Europe, both in academic and political discourse, on national and EU level (e.g. SCENAR 2020, EURURALIS etc.). On the other hand, although the majority of rural areas in Croatia face tremendous demographic and economic challenges, to our knowledge no scenario-based research has been done and only a few partial impact analyses have been conducted in recent Croatian agricultural policy. Therefore, the main objectives of the CRORURIS study are as follows: 1. to develop a conceptual framework for understanding recent change in rural Croatia; 2. to develop methodological framework for identifying predominant trends and key uncertainties, differentiating them geographically and projecting them forward using statistical modelling and Delphi method; 3. to construct alternative future scenarios and relate them to the context of rural Europe. 					 				|	|Economy|	|scenario, rural areas, typology, planning, modelling, Delphi, Croatia|

The controlled and deliberate synthesis of halogen-bonded cocrystals involving metal-organic building blocks remains an outstanding challenge of crystal engineering, materials science and solid-state supramolecular chemistry. The proposed research will open a path to synthesize new molecular materials with controlled 1-, 2- or 3-D architectures, involving metal-organic building blocks which are expected to provide access to new magnetic, optical and electrical properties not usually available in carbon-based supramolecular networks. In particular, besides establishing the fundamental aspects of the design of halogen-bonded metal-organic materials, the proposed research will explore the application of these designs in the synthesis of photoresponsive switching materials, specifically of cocrystals capable of transforming light into mechanical motion. Another element of the proposed research project will be the design and synthesis of purely organic halogen-bonded multi-component materials. The field of halogen-bonded cocrystals has so far been heavily limited by the poor availability of diverse halogen bond donor building blocks. A particular strength of the assembled research team lies in the extensive experience in covalent synthesis, coordination chemistry and crystal engineering, enabling the synthesis of new halogen bond donors of different bonding strength and directionality, which will be employed for the fundamental studies of halogen bonding synthons, of reliable strategies for the construction of extended halogen bonded metal-organic materials, and of isostructural metal-organic cocrystals as a means to fine-tune the properties of solid materials by introducing minute differences into a given cocrystal architecture. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Halogen bond, metal-organic materials, cocrystals, supramolecular chemistry, mechanosynthesis|

From the 18 to the 19th C the revolution in natural, human and technical sciences marks the beginning of modern society and contemporary approach in arts and architecture. Although Grand Tour originally focused on Rome, the exploration of the Ancient World as the origin of Neolassicism widened its travelling radius onto further parts of the Roman Empire, among which Dalmatia held a prominent position. Drawings and literary works by travel artists and writers from that period are treasured in prestigious European museums and libraries and together constitute a priceless portion of European cultural heritage. For the first time, all known travelogues and drawings about Dalmatia from that period will be collected, analysed and evaluated in terms of literary theory and theory of architecture. The overall aim of the project is to identify, problematise and integrate the issues related to the phenomenon of recording the space, predominantly in Dalmatia. The specific goals of the project are: establishing a working group of young researchers; raising issues of international relevance related to description of Dalmatian space based on works of the 18th and 19th C artists and writers; advancing the development of research methodology; making applicable the research of contemporary cultural-spatial context for critical rethinking in contemporary approach to architecture; creating a platform for further research at international level; establishing a dissemination channel towards both European scientific circles and wider audience.

Advantages of MDIs for a permanent clinical use are their low cost and simple procedures. Although they exist at the dental market for 10 years, evidence based prospective clinical studies for definition of their clinical protocols and long term outcomes are missing. Therefore we plan to study first their mechanical properties on models considering placement torque, fracture torque, possibility of fracture upon cycling loads or strain loads. A situation similar to real one will be simulated by using different bone hardness models (dense vs, low density bone) with 2 different oral mucosa widths, and with insertion of 1, 2, 3 or 4 MDIs of different width and length for overdenture retention. 3D prints will be helpful in model development. Further, prospective clinical studies based on both, patient based outcomes (assessed by psychometrically approved questionnaires) and clinical parameters (implant survival, any complications, bone level adjecent to implants, bone resorption at posterior edentulous sites under a denture base, cortical indices changes at the low border of the mandible, gonion angle and antegonion pitch values, bone density in the region of interest expressed as equvivalents of actual Cu stepwedge thickness attached during exposure, plaque, gingival and calculus indices, ISQ values) will be performed. Baseline data will be compared to a 1-year and 3-year outcomes. Patient based outcomes will be compared with clinical data. Results considering clinical parameters (bone quality, quantity, density) will be compared to similar data in complete denture wearers, in overdenture patients with dentures retained by 2-standard size implants and in individuals with natural dentition.

Repeated drug taking leads to neuroadaptations which over time affect neural networks and change behavior. One such change induced by drugs and commonly studied in lab animals is behavioral sensitization. Regulation of gene expression is one important mechanism by which drugs change the plasticity of the networks which regulate behavior. A group of transcriptional regulators of the molecular circadian clock have been identified to function as regulators of behavioral sensitization to cocaine in Drosophila. Subsequent studies in rodents proved the universality of those genes in mediating drug responses. The genetic pathways and molecular interactions through which circadian genes regulate drug responses has remained undefined. We hypothesize that new genes which interact with circadian genes in the regulation of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants can be identified in a genetic screen in Drosophila. This is a goal for which Drosophila is perfectly suited, because genetic screens aimed at defining new genes can be performed relatively easy, fast and cheap. Our first aim is to devise a high-throughput method for measuring behavioral sensitization in flies by modifying the existing method for measuring activity. Second, we will undertake a directed behavioral screen by pre-selecting candidates with reported molecular interaction with circadian genes. In the third aim we will use transgenic flies and other genetic tools to investigate neural mechanisms involved in behavioral sensitization. The proposed research is innovative and relevant for human health. New gene candidates isolated in this screen could easily be translated into mammalian research where they will help in further understanding of neuroplastic changes induced by psychostimulants. Given our expertise and available resources the project has great potential to advance the field. 					 				|	|Biology|	|addiction, psychostimulants, Drosophila, circadian, genes, screen|

Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, and time of introduction of invasive species is essential for assessing the threats. Warming is expected to force species to shift their distributions by expanding into new climatic areas. Several projects have shown that genotypes have increasingly migrated to the north in the last decade, mainly caused by climate change. Records of changes as a result of pest-host-climate change interaction, including possible reasons for changes, are a crucial point of forest monitoring which forms the basis for control strategies and forest management decisions. We will build case studies to represent a specific pest-host-climate change interaction model: native and potentially invasive: i) from one isolated population to other population, (Gypsy Moth); ii) from one climate/geographic region to another (Abraxas pantaria) and non-native potentially invasive in a new climate/geographic region (Cydalima perspectalis). The study presents an extensive research on targeted insect pests in Croatia, taking into account the biology of the pest and host plants and all aspects of the bioecology of the species like genetic constitution and origin, thermal requirements, possible host plants, palatability, influence of antagonists etc.) that influence its spread in a novel environment influenced by climate change and possible serious damage. All the gained data could be used for predictive pest risk analysis models for the researched species, as well as for other native and non-native invasive species that could become a serious threat to Croatian forest ecosystems in changed climate conditions in the near future. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|invasive forest pests, climate change, biodiversity, insect pathology, Lymantria dispar, Abraxas pantaria,Cydalima perspectalis|

Whilst it is recognized that there are justified reasons for acquisition and sharing videos in manners such as security, bio-terrorism surveillance applications, low enforcement and forensics, there is also a strong need for protecting the privacy of the guiltless individuals who are inevitably captured in the recordings. Video surveillance is privacy intrusive because it allows the observation of certain information that is considered privacy intrusive. Face has central role in the process of human recognition and identification in videos, thus the special attention has to be devoted to the face de-identification methods for privacy protection. De-identification addresses, in context of our project, the automated methods of concealing or/and removing face identifiers of individuals captured in videos. The importance of privacy protection is mirrored in documents such as UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and EU’s Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) as well as commissioned review of the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) by the EU Information Commissioner’s Office from July 2008.

Beside scientific objectives and goals (robust face localization, novel methods for face de-identification in videos, preserving data utility and naturalness in de-identification videos, privacy protection), the main objectives of the proposed project are human resources (early stage researchers and PhD students) development by transfer of knowledge in the fields of advanced technologies to carry out problem-oriented research, and increasing a competitiveness level of the research team for Horizon 2020 project applications. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|privacy protection, biometric identification, de-identification, surveillance systems, video|

This capability is now widely exploited in a variety of scenarios to obtain audio-video recordings of people, raising serious privacy concerns. The protection of sensitive private data is required by EU’s Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). De-identification in multimedia content can be defined as the process of concealing identities of individuals captured in a given set of data, for the purpose of protecting their privacy. Soft biometric and non-biometric characteristics such as tattoos, birthmarks, scars or dressing style also carry potentially identity-revealing information and have to be dealt with in the process of de-identification. This is an interdisciplinary challenge, involving such scientific areas as image processing, video tracking and biometrics. This project proposal aims to development of novel and robust methods for de-identification of soft and non-biometric identifiers in videos and images. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|De-Identification, Privacy Protection, Image Processing, Video Processing, Biometrics, Multimedia|

Through a synergy in the synthetic, spectroscopic and computational techniques, we plan to focus our investigations on designing and characterizing a whole catalogue of compounds with desirable analytical and chemical features. Experimental work will involve traditional and ''click-chemistry'' strategies for the synthesis of a number of diverse benzimidazole, benzothiazole, 1,2,3-triazole, and coumarin derivatives, which will be incorporated into a range of organic, inorganic and hybrid polymeric matrices to form sensitive thin films or polymeric nanoparticles. Subsequently, through the UV/Vis and fluorescent spectroscopies, these will be assessed for their abilities to form both solution- and solid-phase complexes with metal cations in order to produce usable chemosensors. The choice of the metal analytes will be prompted by their biological significance or their presence in the environment, comprising cations such as Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Ag+, Cd2+, Fe2+/Fe3+, and Pb2+. All phases of experimental work will be supplemented with the computational support to aid in the interpretation of results. This will include calculating the conformational, tautomeric and pKa features of investigated systems, predicting the modes and free-energies of metal binding, and modeling the changes in the matching UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra induced by the metal complexation and solution pH variations. In addition, computations will be advanced by considering substituted derivatives of the prepared organic frameworks in order to fine-tune the preferred properties, thus helping in the guided selection of future directions. Overall, the presented research is intended to pose this team for the advancements in the field of chemosensors with the promise of a wide range of industrial applications. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|metal-ion and pH sensors, fluorescent chemosensors, click-chemistry derived fluorophores, sol-gel nanomaterials, nitrogen heterocycles|

The main goals of the project are: solidification control and optimization of the casting technology based on the microstructural and thermodynamical simulation, establishing relationships between microstructure and desired mechanical properties of Cu-SMA, optimization of heat treatment to achieve desired microstructure, fine tuning of the production technology parameters towards the definite microstructure and functional properties of alloys and development of the physical and thermodynamic models capable of anticipating microstructure evolution. The proposed goals pertain to the effort to prepare unique SMAs with potential application in machine-building and electronic purposes. Investigation in this project will consist of eight work packages: WP1-Computational alloy design aided by mesoscopic and microscopic modelling, WP2- Thermodynamic modelling and constitution of alloys phase diagrams, WP3-Preparation of master alloys, WP4-Casting of alloys and microstructure evolution, WP5-Heat treatment of alloys, WP6-Characterization of alloys, WP7-Testing of functional properties of alloys, WP8-Project management. Casting of alloys will be realized by three techniques: casting in moulds, continuous casting and melt spinning technique. Diverse methods for characterization of alloys (OM, SEM, EDS, TEM, XRD, DSC, DTA, AAS, etc.) as well as examination of their functional properties (shape memory effect, corrosion and electrochemical properties, etc.) will be used. The results achieved will provide novel relationships of microstructural, mechanical and functional properties of alloys and their correlations in order to shift the knowledge limit for preparation, casting and heat treatment of investigated alloys.

OP compounds used as pesticides account for over 3,000,000 registered accidental or deliberate cases of poisoning per year worldwide. Furthermore, OPs known as nerve agents (soman, sarin, tabun, VX) present a threat in terrorist attacks and conflicts, as was the case recently in Syria. The main targets of OP compounds are cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the essential enzyme in neurotransmission, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), its back-up enzyme. However, the antidotes currently in use, which act as reactivators of inhibited AChE, were empirically synthesized before the two enzyme’s crystal structures were resolved. Due to structural requirements, their binding affinity and reactivation rate have not been well-balanced. This project utilizes new compounds to gain a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of the limitations of reactivation and find new effective leads for further in vivo study. We will combine several approaches, including: a study of the finely tuned interplay between these two sister enzymes, computational and experimental studies of cholinesterase interactions with a wide range of ligands defining favourable characteristic for potential new antidotes, in silico design of novel compounds that will direct the subsequent synthesis of selected leads, and thorough in vitro and in vivo experimental evaluation guided by strict cost-benefit criteria. Such a comprehensive approach will enable us to test a wide selection of candidates in a more reliable manner and obtain unambiguous data for further enhancements of the antidotal treatment. This will also enable us to explore other possible OP treatments such as highly-effective bioscavengers. Many of the findings that would arise from this project should have an impact that reaches far beyond the level of cholinesterases. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, bioscavengers, prophylaxis, in silico drug-design, oximes, bronchodilatators|

The project will focus on rational design, synthesis and biological screening of novel derivatives of three marketed drugs: antimalarial primaquine and two antitumoral drugs vorinostat and sorafenib. The potential for discovery of new anticancer agents among antimalarials was first noted when commonly used antimalarials showed significant anticancer activity (7 of them have reached a clinical stage of development). We have focused our attention to primaquine, the antimalarial agent with quinoline moiety. In our several papers novel urea and semicarbazide primaquine derivatives with strong antiproliferative activity and/or high selectivity were reported. The highest selectivity against MCF-7 cells and practically no activity against other tested cancer cell lines showed hybrid of two primaquine ureas. Based on these results we intend to design, synthesize and evaluate novel primaquine hybrid compounds as potential anticancer agents. First objective is to design and prepare novel twin drugs based on primaquine and vorinostat scaffolds 3-6. These compounds will differ in length of aliphatic chain and/or functional groups: compounds 3 are esters, 4 are carboxylic acids and 6 hydroxamic acids like vorinostat itself. Reduction of compounds 4 would generate amines 7 and amides 8. Further on, we plan to prepare primaquine amides 9 with substituted cinnamic acid and sorafenib analogs 14 based on pyrazine structure, hoping that additional nitrogen atom would increase the binding interactions. To study how the amide part of the molecule affects the activity and physico-chemical properties of the new pyrazine analogs, the preparation of a number of amides is planned. All new compounds will be screened for cytostatic activity in vitro on several human cancer cell lines, inhibition of specific enzymes and antioxidative activity. 					 				|	|Pharmaceutical sciences|	|synthesis, primaquine, sorafenib, vorinostat, cytostatic|

In the present context of market liberalization, increased competition, technological innovation and vanishing trade barriers, the investigation of the determinants that are relevant and significant in explaining firms’ business success becomes crucial. Having previous in mind, the first goal of this research proposal is to create a model that will identify factors that determine firms' success. When compared with the previous empirical research, the designed model will be improved in several ways: (1) it will encompass the dynamic aspect of firms’ success while simultaneously analysing firm-level, industry-level and macroeconomic determinants of profitability; (2) it will consider nonlinear effects of profitability determinants and different measures of performance (traditional and cash flow performance indicators). Formulation of such a model doesn’t exist, not only in the Croatian manufacturing sector, but even in the Central and Eastern Europe. Aside from identifying the drivers of firms’ success, we also intend to determine the factors that explain firms’ financial failure i.e. we will create a model that will be able to predict the probability of firms’ bankruptcy. Besides using traditional firms’ performance indicators we will also use an Operating Cash Flow Capacity, what represents original idea and improvement of modelling since this variable could be more reliable than net income regarding the latent problem of earnings management. As far as we know, no other research before used this measure of performance for the prediction of a firms’ failure (bankruptcy). Additionally, we will use an approach with three or more classes of firm failure status. For this part of the research, the logistic regression as well as a novel and sophisticated econometric method i.e. neural networks will be applied. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Firms' success, profitability, manufacturing industry, bankruptcy, dynamic panel analysis, multiple regression, logistic regression|

The number and share of high-growth enterprises is relatively small, but the number and share of jobs they create is disproportionally large. The small and medium enterprises with the potential of growth are in the focus of this project. Two overarching goals of this project are: 1. Development of growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia The main activities leading up to this goal are: (i) to analyse previous studies relevant for the topic of SMEs' growth potential; (ii) to develop growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia; (iii) to make the models for assessing growth potential available to SMEs to use for purposes of assessing and improving their businesses; (iv) to compare differences in growth potential among SMEs from main industries; (v) to analyse growth potential of SMEs within creative industries and within manufacturing industries. 2. Providing recommendations to policy makers, recommendation for development of educational programs for SME owners and managers, and recommendations related to sources of finance available to SMEs Based on the research results and models created as part of this project, the main recommendations related to growth potential of SMEs will cover areas of: (i) policy making; (ii) education; and (iii) sources of finance. In recent years policy makers have shown increased interest in fostering fast growing enterprises as they are seen as a key driver of economic growth and employment. Studies conducted in listed companies have showed that two key aspects in supporting high-growth companies are education and access to finance. To allow for comparison of other countries with Croatia, results of this project will be published in relevant scientific journals. To help boost Croatian economy, the results will be presented to all stakeholders interested in this topic. 					 				|	|Economy|	|prediction of growth potential, high-growth SMEs, creative industry, policy recommendation for high growth SMEs, access to finance for high-growth SME|

In the meantime, technology advancements, cost reduction and governmental incentives have made some renewable energy sources more competitive in the market. Among them, wind energy is the one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources. The conversion of the wind energy into electric energy is of a multidisciplinary nature, involving aerodynamics, mechanical systems, electric machines, power electronics, control theory, and power systems. The main goal of this project is to establish new research group which will improve the quality, performance and competitiveness of industrial sector in the field of wind power generation. The research group has already participated in the project for the development of advanced control structures for induction generator connected via back-to-back-converter to the grid in wind turbine application. As a step forward in innovation, research and development the research focus is set on permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMG) parameter identification, estimation of PMG rotor position using high frequency signal injection and speed estimation. Also, focus is on energy efficient based control method such as model predictive control of PMG. Advanced sensorless control algorithms for PMG will be developed and experimentally verified on the industrial laboratory model. Basic infrastructure for implementation and verification of developed algorithms exists in the Laboratory and for testing of advanced control structures on PMG laboratory model needs to be further upgraded.

In general, shielding analyses can be classified into two categories: preliminary analyses and final analyses. Preliminary analysis can be conducted using computer codes based on engineering methods, the most used one based on point-kernel method. Recent research indicated that a new approach can be used in determination of buildup factors as the key parameters of point-kernel method. The approach is based on machine learning technique, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR). For efficient training of the SVR models of a complex physical problem, an active learning procedure has to be defined. Final shielding analysis is usually conducted by computer codes based on either deterministic or statistic methods placing high time and hardware demands, but resulting in more accurate results. Advanced numerical procedures utilize advantages of both, deterministic approach as well as stochastic approach resulting in a hybrid deterministic-stochastic procedure increasing the efficiency of the overall analysis. The overall objective of the proposed project is the development of the synthesized calculational tool to enable all stages of a shield design to be performed within integrated environment. To accomplish this objective following activities are planned: definition of the optimal active learning procedure in regression framework to prepare data sets for SVR model creation, investigation of gamma and neutron buildup factors and preparation of SVR models, development of the computational tool for preliminary stage shielding design, optimization of hybrid deterministic-stochastic numerical procedure, development of the control module for automatic shielding analyses process control, preparation of front-end and back-end interface, testing of the final shielding analysis environment. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|machine learning, active learning, parallel and distributed computing, gamma shielding, neutron shielding|

Although the research is largely focused on metals, polymers, glass, ceramics, composites, etc.., increasing interest is devoted to biological systems and materials (shells, bone, spider silk, muscle or similar) due to their characteristics that are significantly above those of conventional materials. Behavior and modeling of biological materials is complex, but as the modeling of conventional materials, it is based on the knowledge and experimental determination of their characteristics. To describe the behavior of materials, beside material model, the basic prerequisite is the identification of material parameters. It was found that for the identification of parameters of biological materials necessary for the modeling of their behavior, it is advisable to apply the evolutionary methods, especially genetic algorithm. In the project, the behavior of the neck ligaments of human spine will be characterized and modelled based on data obtained by experiments. A hyperelastic material model that can be used for compressible and incompressible materials is selected for that puprose. In order to more efficiently produce the required values of material parameters, a technique for determining the parameters based on genetic algorithm will be developed. In order to optimize the procedure to obtain the parameters specified materials, complex genetic algorithm and its operators will be developed, applying the appropriate objective function optimization procedure. Because of it's flexibility and robustness, the proposed methodology for the materials characterization is expected to be applicable to the characterization of other non-conventional and innovative materials of complex behavior. To this end, relevant published experimental results will be collected and systematized in order to create the basis for the characterization of other innovative materials. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|biological materials, material characterization, material model, material parameters, genetic algorithm|

Many grapevine cultivars and clones used in production today are actually periclinal chimeras formed by spontaneous mutation of cells in certain layer of apical meristem (i.e. Pinot noir, gris and meunier). Many intervarietal and interspecific chimeras are also detected which are formed from two different genotypes (cultivars or species). This type of chimeras can arise spontaneously from graft tissue, but this process can also be controlled. This is the base for development of chimeral breeding, as a very interesting but underutilized plant breeding method. In project proposal research on the possibilities of in vitro methods of development and detection of grapevine intravarietal synthetic chimeras will be performed, but also chimeras of grapevine and other Vitis species (with resistance to phyloxera, downy and powdery mildew). In the first stage of the project research on conditions for in vitro organogenesis of 20 different genotypes (10 grapevine cultivars, 5 rootstocks and 5 genotypes of Vitis species). In next stage of the project genotypes with similar requirements for organogenesis conditions will be chosen, and organogenesis will be induced from mixed tissue of at least three pairs of genotypes. After organogenesis, detection of all chimeral plants will be performed. Identification and confirmation of chimeras will be performed using combination of phenotypic markers (i.e. color of epiderm ) and by analyzing genotypes using microsatellite marker (SSR).

The 3D printer takes the virtual design from computer-aided design (CAD) software and reproduces it layer-by-layer until the physical definition of the layers gives the designed object. The significant advantage of this technique is that the architecture can be concisely controlled. Aim of the 3Dmicroreactors project is research and development of polymeric composite materials for use in 3D printing of intricate milli- and microreactors. The 3Dmicroreactors project team members come from 4 different departments and are specialists in different parts of materials and chemical engineering, guaranteeing multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity of the project. In the 3Dmicroreactors project we will, by using polymeric composite materials, build microreactors with high precision, including complex geometries and intricate internal structures - such as channels with well-defined size dimensions. Furthermore, integration of sensors and catalysts in the construction material, and understanding material properties and kinetics of the processes will enable the designing of the reactionware, allowing us to combine additional materials and kinetic knowledge with reactor designs. The additive manufacturing process of the devices takes a short time and will result in a cheap procedure for the fabrication of fluidic devices. 3D printing technology will enable chemical engineers to design and fabricate their own inexpensive reaction vessels with the push of a few buttons opposing to paying experts for production of intricate glassware and specialized reactors. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|microreactors, 3D printing, kompoziti, catalytic materials, polymer blends|

HE as a system, along with HE institutions, must be innovative and strategically managed to be able to fulfill their mission. Therefore, the decision making accompanied by evaluation of its implementation in higher education is an issue of highest priority. Primary goal of this research proposal is to develop a complete methodology for strategic decision making and the monitoring of its implementation in HE. The enrollment rate within online education has skyrocketed worldwide and there are a number of reports on e-readiness and ICT use in HE. Two basic components of the project: 1. Development of methodological framework for strategic decision making in HE and monitoring of its implementation. 2. Application, adjustment and evaluation of the methodology on the example of decision implementation on e-learning and distance learning. This is an interdisciplinary project connecting Social Sciences (ICT, multicriteria decision making, strategic planning) and Mathematics (mathematical modeling, quantitative methods in decision making, structural causal models and graph theory). The research is structured as a cycle of strategic decision making with four phases: (1) Intelligence - problem identification and research, advancement of methodologies such as readiness assessment, diffusion of innovation etc. (2) Design of methodology - design of decision making methodology and decision making, improvement of multicriteria decision analysis in HE. (3) Implementation and monitoring - research and identification of key factors that determine effectiveness of strategic decision, their correlation, design of measuring model for maturity and effectiveness of strategic decision implementation in HE (4) Evaluation - survey possible approaches and evaluation by application of J. Pearl’s structural causal models for identification of effects of strategic decision. 					 				|	|Information and communication sciences|	|decision making, e-learning, open and distant learning, higher education, e-readiness, risk assessment, portfolio, causality, AHP|

Besides its primary purpose, land administration system can and should also serve as a basis for land management. Different to the land administration, land management is a set of processes ensuring that the land is used in an efficient and sustainable manner. Unfortunately, land administration systems are rarely able to fulfill such additional requirements, even in the developed countries. This project aims at finding what needs to be done in order to transform a traditional land administration system into a modern multipurpose land administration system (MLAS), which can efficiently support land management. Our hypothesis says that such a transformation can be done by improving two aspects of a LAS, its efficiency and its usability. Under efficiency we consider the ability of a LAS to update its data quickly whilst ensuring the consistency and correctness thereof. Within the project we will investigate options for outsourcing the preparation of transactions to private sector and the possibilities to more efficiently collect field data within the improved process of updating LAS data. Even more important that its efficiency, is the usability of a LAS. This is the second aspect that we try to improve within the project. Besides the mere registration of the land, MLAS must be able to efficiently support processes of land valuation, urban planning and various rearrangements aiming to increase agricultural productivity of the land. Within the project we will investigate which additional data needs to be collected, processed and stored within the LAS in order to enable efficient support to land management processes. As a starting point for the research we use our previous research closely related to the topics of land administration and land management, and the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), which recently became the ISO standard. 					 				|	|Geodesy|	|Land Administration System, Land Registers, Land Management, Sustainable Development, Geoinformation|

The conventional choice, organosphosphates and pyrethroids, has many disadvantages due to considerable hazard of harmful residues, high cost, and the possible and already present appearance of insect resistance. The possible alternative, diatomaceous earth (DE), because of the needs to use high concentrations to control insects, is hindered by its effect on grain flow, bulk density and very high cost. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of a new, less toxic and less dangerous insecticide(s) to control insect pests of stored food and in Public Health/Pest Control field. Synergism of DE and botanicals allows effective control with much lower concentrations of active ingredients, in comparison when these components are used separately. The mode of action is a synergistic combination of desiccation, poisoning and (probably) starvation. Croatia has several sources of DE that are still not in use. These DEs have a potential to be used as natural insecticides or combining it with other natural substances to develop safe, effective and natural insecticide. Also, Croatia has a botanical diversity of indigenous plants. However, the country has not yet benefited from this wealth of knowledge on the use of plants as pesticides. These results make us confident that there is a possibility to develop the new natural synergized insecticide formulation(s) using Croatian DE and plant extract. The proposed project fits the goals and strategic priorities CSF because it encourages the international competitiveness of research groups,developing scientific field that provides the technological advances applicable to agriculture, food industry, public health, communal hygiene and veterinary medicine as well as the ability to obtain new Croatian natural products. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|natural insecticides, inert dusts, botanical insecticides, stored pest, stored products|

The process of crack initiation starts at a micro-scale, and with progressive growth, micro-cracks coalesce into macro-cracks representing discontinuities in the material. Therefore, a realistic modelling of crack initiation and propagation is one of the key factors that affect the reliability of the model for analysing the structures, especially those subjected to earthquakes. Sophisticated numerical models based on time dependent and incremental dynamic analysis can play an important role in simulating the behaviour of such structures before and after collapse. This project aims to develop two nonlinear numerical models for incremental dynamic analysis of structures based on the model of discrete cracks. The first one will be a novel 3D model for reinforced concrete and stone masonry structures strengthened with clamps and bolts based on the combined finite discrete element method where the cracks are modelled through the contact elements implemented between finite elements. The model enables crack initiation and propagation, dynamic interaction of separate elements and monitoring of structural behaviour before and after the collapse. The second model will be based on the finite element method with embedded discontinuity and embedded reinforcement, which allows for crack initiation and propagation independent of finite element mesh and will be applied to reinforced concrete structures. The novel numerical models for reinforced concrete structures will be validated by available experimental research, while our own experiments are planned to be performed at shaking table for the validation of stone masonry structure model. Thereafter, the comparative analysis of the behaviour of real structures with both models will be conducted. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|Numerical modelling, Earthquake loading, RC structures, Stone masonry structures, Discrete cracks|

The main goal of this proposal is to develop novel polymer nanocomposites of extending photoactivity toward visible region under UV/VIS light irradiation and to introduce an innovative technology for water purification. The conducting polymers (CPs) are known as good hole conducting materials1 and are combined with semiconductor nanoparticles to produce a synergistic effect and complementary properties. Due to that Polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conducting polymers will be studied with metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO) nanoparticles to develop polymer nanocomposite photocatalysts (CPNPs) with enhanced photocatalytic properties. The optimal structure-properties relationships are crucial for efficient degradation of organic contaminants in water to convert them into harmless chemicals. Novel CPNPs will be applied in photocatalytic degradation of organic azo dyes (reactive red 45 and methyl orange) chosen as targeted wastewater pollutants. The utilization of waste material, fly ash, as a catalyst support will be explored to provide the additional environmental benefit. The proposed integral approach that will be used in the evaluation of the process efficiency will scrutinize any negative implications of CPNPs application. The project will contribute to the development and modernization of science and technology in Croatia, advancing toward the knowledge-based society within the European research area. Project includes a multidisciplinary effort, ranging from polymer science and technology, chemistry and environmental chemistry to electrochemical engineering, in order to meet challenging project tasks and propose an efficient photocatalytic polymer nanocomposite for sustainable water treatment technology. 1.

In the framework of this project, a variety of such compounds will be designed, synthesised, and characterised. A series of novel calixarene derivatives capable of strongly and selectively binding cations and anions will be prepared. Some of these compounds are aimed to be efficient liquid-liquid extraction agents whereas the others will be designed to be water-soluble or to bear fluorescent and amino-acid substituents. Another class of anion receptors which will be synthesised comprises amine, amide, urea, and thiourea derivatives of dehydroacetic acid. The complexation abilities of all the compounds mentioned towards various substrates will be explored by using an integrated approach which includes thermodynamic, computational, and structural studies. A number of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods as well as (micro)calorimetry will be employed. That should yield detailed and reliable thermodynamic data (stability constants, reaction and solution Gibbs energies, enthalpies and entropies). In order to facilitate the design of the targeted molecules and to assist the interpretation of the experimental results, the molecular dynamics simulations of the systems studied will be carried out. This will, together with the results of NMR studies and that of solid-state X-ray diffraction investigations, also ensure information about structural characteristics of the receptors and their complexes. Particular attention will be focused on the hydrogen-bonding and solvation effects on the equilibria of binding reactions. For that reason, many solvents with different solvation and hydrogen-bonding affinities will be used. The obtained thermodynamic information is expected to provide a detailed insight into the complexation processes and the influence of medium on the reactions studied, which will allow further development of efficient supramolecular receptors. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|ion receptors, calixarenes, dehydroacetic acid, complexation, solvation, hydrogen bonding, thermodynamics|

So antitoxins are produced by immunisation of animals, mostly horse and sheep, by appropriate antigen of interest (upstream part of the process), and subsequent purification of induced immunoglobulins from the hyperimmunised animal plasma (downstream part of the process). Established cost-effective antitoxin production has an additional value serving as a platform that can be easily adapted for fast production of therapeutics to combat new emerging diseases (ebola, for example). The aim of the here proposed research is to design and optimise at the laboratory scale the most effective and most compact purification process (downstream part) based on the current scientific and technological knowledge. The process will be designed by balancing between criteria for fulfilling the growing regulatory demands, purification process yields (as high as possible) and the production costs (as low as possible). The aim is to find the optimal parameters of each purification step, to investigate the effectiveness of the designed process in reducing the risk of viral contamination, and to generate data on laboratory scale that could serve as the basis for decision making process regarding the sustainable antitoxin production plant establishment. The project will investigate for the first time the applicability of single-step simultaneous caprylic acid precipitation and peptic digestion of horse plasma, demonstrated so far only in ovine IgG purification, and the capability of this step in reducing the risk of viral contamination, that has not been investigated yet. Further on, the applicability of monolithic chromatographic supports (convective interaction media) in the process of antitoxin purification will be explored for the first time. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|antitoxin, antivenom, downstream processing, virus inactivation, (Fab')2 fragments|

The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion. Antioxidant is a foreign substance that reacts with the oxidant faster than the components of the cell. An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favour of the oxidants is termed oxidative stress. Antioxidants act as free radical scavengers and therefore can lower the risk of numerous degenerative diseases by preventing damages caused by free radicals. Fruits and vegetables are the major sources of antioxidants in human diet. Several natural compounds found in food, such as polyphenols, vitamins A and E, and some carotenoids, have been found to show excellent antioxidant activity. Chlorophylls and their derivatives have also been reported to possess this activity. However, literature is still scarce regarding their antioxidant properties. It is known that the amount of each antioxidant in fruits, vegetables and their derivatives is strongly influenced by numerous factors such as agro-technical processes, environmental conditions, processing factors and storage conditions. Continuous monitoring of antioxidant capacity of plant-based foods through different phases, from cultivation to storage, is needed to maintain or even improve the beneficial properties of food. The goal of this project is to develop several cyclic multi-pulse voltammetric techniques for the characterization of natural antioxidants and to apply them in routine analysis of food quality. Experimental results will be explained by the comparison with the theoretical simulation of responses of various electrode mechanisms of independent and conjugated multiple redox centers. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|voltammetry, antioksidans, radicals, squave wave, simulations|

One of the main topics of research in this project will be Diophantine m-tuples (sets with the property that the product of its any two distinct elements increased by 1 is a perfect square) and their generalizations. The first Diophantine quadruple {1,3,8,120} was found by Fermat. Baker and Davenport proved that Fermat's set cannot be extended to a quintuple. This result motivated the famous conjecture that there does not exist a Diophantine quintuple. Dujella proved that there does not exist a Diophantine sextuple and that there are only finitely many Diophantine quintuples. Recently, Filipin, Fujita and Elsholtz significantly improved previously known upper bounds for the number of Diophantine quintuples, but the main conjecture still remains open. Various generalizations of Diophantine m-tuples will be studied, in particular, considering the problem in the rings of integers of number fields of small degree. Diophantine triples were used by Dujella in construction of high-rank elliptic curves over Q and Q(T) and new results in that direction are expected. In determining exactly the Mordell-Weil group of several elliptic curves over Q(T), an important tool is recent algorithm by Gusić and Tadić for finding rationals at which the specialization map is injective. We plan to improve and extend this algorithm for elliptic curves over K(T) for general number fields K. Members of the group will also work on Thue, Thue-Mahler and index forms equations, problems related to sums of divisors, polynomial root separation and applications of Diophantine approximations to cryptanalysis. The results of the research will be published in respectable journals and presented on international conferences. Through this project we will intensify our scientific connections with international number-theorists and qualify young researchers for scientific research in number theory. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Diophantine equations, elliptic curves, Diophantine approximations, polynomials, cryptography|

In the 1990s, Vogan conjectured a strengthening of Parthasarathy's Dirac inequality, which relates the cohomology of the Dirac operator to the infinitesimal character of the representation. This conjecture was proved in a joint paper with Huang . In further research, in part joint with various collaborators (Barbasch, Huang, Kang, Mehdi, Protsak, Renard, Somberg, Zhu) , we related Dirac cohomology to other kinds of cohomology, calculated it explicitly for many interesting representations, and studied algebraic Dirac induction, a construction of representations with given Dirac cohomology. The proposed project will continue this research in several directions: 1) the study of representations obtained by Dirac induction, in particular the discrete series representations (doctoral research of Ana Prlić). 2) applying Dirac cohomology to problems of restricting representations. Some instances of this have been studied with Huang-Zhu and with Somberg. 3) trying to strengthen the Dirac inequality, which should have implications for the study of unitary representations. Some preliminary work on the convex hull conjecture of Salamanca-Vogan has been done with Renard. 4) calculating the Dirac cohomology of unipotent representations. Some cases of this have been obtained jointly with Barbasch. This could lead to better understanding of characters of unipotent representations, which is related to the Assem conjecture. It would also be interesting to calculate the Dirac cohomology of unitary highest weight modules. Other topics we plan to cover include studying translation principle for Dirac index (joint with Mehdi and Vogan); studying n-cohomology and BGG resolutions using Penrose transforms (joint with Soucek); studying some abstract homotopy and homology theory, with applications to tensor categories of representations (doctoral research of Matija Bašić). 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Harish-Chandra modules, Dirac operators, cohomology, Dirac induction, branching problems|

As the appropriate functioning of the soil is essential for terrestrial ecosystems and human activity the risk of its impairment should be taken very seriously. Among numerous pollutants present in the environment, pesticides, due to their wide and common usage and impact on non-target organisms, represent one of the major soil pollutants. More recently nanoparticles (NPs) have been brought into focus as the increased interest for their usage in agriculture highlights the importance of understanding its ecotoxicological effects. The proposed project aims to identify the various effects of NPs and pesticides mixtures on non-targeted soil organisms, but also to identify the interactions of metal-based NPs and pesticides. In order to deliver the specified objectives of the project we propose a comprehensive ecotoxicological research which includes various levels of complexity (from preliminary laboratory to semi-field experiments), different endpoints (from molecular to population level), different exposure scenarios (single-mixture, short-long, single application-sequence of applications) and inclusion of both model and native soil organisms. Additionally, based on experimental data on toxic effects of selected pesticides and metal-based NPs, population-level matrix models will be constructed. From the model outputs the effects of investigated toxicants will be assessed and used to establish under which set of conditions a modelled population will respond to applied toxicants and alter its potential to respond to other stressors. The expected results will improve the state of knowledge on toxicity of mixtures on non-targeted soil organisms and can be implemented in risk assessment process. Consequently, expected results can enhance soil protection and soil ecological sustainability. 					 				|	|Biology|	|metal based nanoparticles, mixture toxicity, environmental risk assessment, soil fauna, earthworm, ecotoxicology|

For decades, chestnut blight, a disease caused by one of the world´s most aggressive invasive pathogens Cryphonectria parasitica has been causing high mortality in chestnut forest populations and orchards. However, the fungus can be controlled by the naturally-occurring virus Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1) which causes a reduction in fungal virulence and sporulation (a phenomenon called hypovirulence), which in turn enables infected trees to recover. Hypovirulence is the most efficient way to successfully control chestnut blight in Europe, but unfortunately the spread of CHV-1 is limited by the fungal diversity and its sexual reproduction. This project aims at revealing individual and joint aspects of the dynamic three-lateral interaction between chestnut, its fungal pathogen and the pathogen-biocontrol agent-virus. The proposed study will: (1) reveal the diversity of natural chestnut populations in south-eastern Europe, (2) connect the sequences and 3-D structures of CHV1 subtype I proteins with the level of fungal hypovirulence, (3) reveal the role of epigenetic changes of fungal genome in respect to hypovirus infection and geographical spread of the fungus (4) assess the efficiency of naturally-occurring virus isolates to induce chestnut recovery in natural conditions. The results will also contribute to the combat efforts against chestnut blight in the field conditions, by enabling production of therapeutic paste for induction of recovery in a valuable chestnut cultivar. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|biological control, chestnut disease, epigenetics, hypovirulence, molecular ecology|

The RecA protein is a key component of recombinational systems in bacteria. Its homologs are also present in higher organisms including humans. RecA functions in the form of nucleoprotein filaments that are assembled on single-stranded DNA, and which catalyze pairing and strand exchange between two homologous DNA duplexes. In Escherichia coli, the RecBCD and RecFOR protein complexes mediate RecA filament assembly, and consequently, play an important role in recombination. We have recently discovered that some E. coli mutants recombine quite efficiently in the absence of both RecBCD and RecFOR complexes. This recombination is RecA-dependent suggesting the existence of an alternative RecA loading activity. The aim of the project is to genetically characterize this RecBCD- RecFOR-independent (RecBFI) recombination pathway, and gain insight into this novel mechanism of RecA filament assembly. Although RecA is crucial for efficient recombination in bacteria, the recA mutants of radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans display a significant residual ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Recent results from our group have shown that this RecA-independent repair is quite inaccurate leading to gross chromosome rearrangements. Our project is to identify the key genes/proteins involved in this RecA-independent repair, and to characterize, at the sequence level, gross genome rearrangements in D. radiodurans. Given that recombination is a fundamental process largely conserved during evolution, our research on bacteria may reveal molecular mechanisms that are applicable to eukaryotic recombination systems. Thus, the results of our project could be instructive for research on cancer and other human hereditary diseases related to defects in DNA recombination functions. 					 				|	|Biology|	|hommologous recombination, DNA repair, genome stability, Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, RecA protein, gross chromosomal rearrangements|

This Slavic vernacular, which was the direct predecessor of present-day Croatian, coexisted with the liturgical Croatian Church Slavic, whose oldest written texts can be dated to the 11th c. The earliest attestations of the Croatian language are scattered throughout written sources of various nature, from individual words found in Latin and Church Slavic texts, glosses, and notes in the margins of medieval codices to Glagolitic epigraphs. This language has not yet been analyzed in its entirety. The backbone of the project will be formed by a corpus of the earliest attested Croatian lexical data. Such a corpus does not yet exist. This early Croatian corpus will reflect the development of the languages between the 9th and 13th centuries, some of the earliest isoglosses between Croatian and other Slavic languages, as well as some of the earliest Croatian dialectal isoglosses and interaction with western European – especially Romance and Germanic – and eastern European cultural and linguistic entities. The earliest onomastic data of Slavic origin plays an important role in this research. The research will be conducted using the traditional methods and tools of historical linguistics, such as text analysis and interpretation and the comparative method. The research team consists of four researchers and five junior researchers from a number of academic institutions (Zagreb, Zadar, Leiden). The aims of the proposed project are: (1) to create a complete collection of the oldest attestations of the Croatian language; (2) to improve our understanding of the structural changes in early Croatian and the rise of the earliest isoglosses within Croatian; (3) to place the beginnings of the Croatian language in a wider Slavic and non-Slavic context. 					 				|	|Philology|	|Old Croatian, Proto-Slavic, onomastics, earliest linguistic attestations, loanwords, issogloses|

In order to accomplish this goal, good economic governance incorporating energy policy should implement reforms that will increase economic efficiency and social prosperity. The sector’s reform experience goes back to the beginning of 1990s, indicating that existing literature has been limited by a relatively short period of time, inadequate hypothesis cross-testing and without appropriate panel-data analysis. Therefore there is a strong need for the systematic analysis that would include EU countries and Croatia as the new EU Member State, a broader range of issues related to energy sector reforms within a longer time frame to examine whether the empirical evidence supports the logic of reforms and to compare the existing evidence on the reform determinants and performance. So far the findings on some issues have been limited and inconclusive. The goal of the research is to better understand the reform process by providing solid economic evidence on energy reform results and its economic and social impacts on sustainable growth. The aim of the research within this project is to address several related issues: 1) internal and external factors that will further influence the progress of reforms, especially in the EU; 2) macroeconomic performance, institutional settings, regulatory prudence and sector governance as the important wider framework; 3) measuring the economic impact of energy reforms in terms of economic efficiency, rate of investments, competitiveness and economic growth; 4) testing the existing risk management models and developing a novel approach to assessing and hedging the risks in the energy market; 5) measuring the social impact of energy reforms in terms of coverage of energy services and welfare; 6) evaluation of the energy reforms impact on long-term and sustainable economic growth. The research will be performed by combining economic and technical approach and research methods. 					 				|	|Economy|	|energy sector, reforms, economic effects, social effects, sustainable economic growth, Croatia, European Union|

Therefore in this research we investigate the features of the sovereign bond markets that are either underexplored or the literature offers conflicting findings. We focus specifically on bond markets in all EU member states and the US, and differentiate seven research segments that are mutually interrelated. First segment applies GARCH-type models and estimates sovereign bond spread volatility and the volatility risk premium. The output of this segment is used in subsequent segments; in the model of spread determinants, volatility spillovers, and capital flight. Second segment is dedicated to the analysis of the statistical properties of sovereign spreads volatility by an application of extreme value theory, self-exciting and Markov switching models. We quantify extremal dependence between spreads and the distribution of clusters of their extreme movements using the extremogram. Two segments are devoted to the analysis of volatility spillovers across bond markets and time-varying degree of sovereign bond market integration in developed and emerging EU countries. We also analyze political factors that may influence the sovereign bond market and cross-border capital movement. In this segment we code political variables employed as explanatory variables in the remaining two segments. Hence segment six estimates the model of spread determinants that includes a more balanced and detailed representation of market sentiment and volatility, fiscal features, and political factors. Due to the fact that in recent times extreme changes in sovereign bond markets induced cross-border reallocation of the capital, in the seventh segment we estimate a capital flight model that includes political factors and sovereign spread volatility premium. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Sovereign bond market, sovereign spreads, volatility spillovers, sovereign bond market integration stochastic volatility models, extreme value theory,|

Educational aspirations are defined as the ambitions and goals pupils hold concerning both immediate and future educational outcomes. Within conceptual framework, educational aspirations are placed at the centre of an ecological system extending from the most proximal levels of the individual pupil, through the level of parents to the more distant levels of class (peers) and school. For each level, psychological concepts are selected in order to investigate the nature and determinants of pupils’ aspirations. The research focuses on the aspirations of pupils from three different cohorts at three transitional periods of elementary education: the introduction to elementary education (1st to 2nd grade), the transition from class to subject teaching (4th to 5th) and the completion of elementary education prior to the transition to secondary education (7th to 8th). The qualitative research phase centres on an in-depth exploration of educational aspirations through a series of semi-structured interviews with participant triads made up of a pupil, his parent and teacher. In this research phase, 24 triads in each of five participating schools will be followed over two academic years. The quantitative phase consists of the repeated administration of a pupil questionnaire in 20 randomly selected schools in Zagreb aimed at examining determinants of and change in pupils’ educational aspirations. In each school, all 4th and 7th grade pupils will be invited to participate at three different time-points over two academic years. The results from both research phases will be integrated through a concurrent examination of individual perspectives over time and the use of statistical modelling from the large samples. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|educational aspirations, pupil perspective, transitional periods in education, longitudinal study, fully integrated mixed model design|

The ubiquitous access to such infrastructure would help to mitigate concerns associated with limited EV range and long charging times. Battery Swapping Stations (BSSs) are poised as effective means of eliminating the EVs long waiting times associated with charging the batteries. These stations are mediators between the power system and their customers. In order to successfully deploy this type of stations, business and operating models are required, that will allow it to generate profits while offering a fast and reliable alternative to charging batteries. The first part of the project is focused on analysis of current scientific and commercial state-of-the-art, as well as legislative. Based on this, a viable business model will be developed as a basis of the BSS business case. The research will then diverge in two directions. The first direction is the optimization of the BSS operation, which includes its day-ahead scheduling and real-time operation. The second direction is the control and communication of the BSS. Namely, each battery’s state-of-charge needs to be properly assessed, and its charging pattern needs to correspond to the one set by the optimization model. The second part of the project will assess the impacts that BSS and a group of BSSs have on power systems. Here, points of view of Distribution and Transmission System Operators will be considered. The final stage of the project will be the deployment of a testbed that consists of a central computer, a large number of EV battery stacks, and all the accompanying control and communications infrastructure. This will provide the opportunity to test the developed algorithms in a realistic environment and to verify the results. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|electric vehicles, batteries, battery swapping station, business model, optimization model|

Particular attention will be paid on a role of water, simple counterions and surface structure in formation of electrical interfacial layer. The single crystal electrode, device developed and constructed recently in our laboratory, will be used for determination of inner surface potential of specific crystal planes. Inner surface potential affects directly the state of ionic species bound to defined surface plane and is thus essential parameter governing interfacial equilibrium. The role of interfacial water in interfacial equilibrium will be analyzed by considering its behavior at inert surfaces but also at metal oxide surfaces. Finally, the results obtained for the particular crystal planes will be applied for colloids and nanoparticles exhibiting different crystal planes to the liquid medium. A special case of interfaces are polyelectrolytes at the metal oxide surface. Therefore, such interfaces and their correlation with the behaviour of polyelectrolytes in solution will be also extensively studied in the frame of the proposed project. The reason lies in fundamental interest to understand their properties in relation with the role of natural polyelectrolytes and proteins in biological processes, as well as in industrial applications. The latter are not limited to polyelectrolytes in solution, but include also the polyelectrolyte (or interpolyelectrolyte) complexes and multilayers. The formation of multilayers of polyelectrolytes at solid surfaces, as well as interpolyelectrolyte interactions in solution, will be examined. Special emphasis will be given on specific ionic effects. Predominantly the experimental methods will be applied, and theoretical tools will be developed in order to better understand behavior, reactivity and equilibrium at interfaces. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|electrical interfatial layer, surface reaction, surface potential, metal oxide, polyelectrolyites,multilayers, complexation, nanoparticles|

Preparation of new glass and glass-ceramics with characteristic properties and the investigation of relationships among compositions, structure, electrical and thermal properties are important for understanding the mechanisms involved in these materials. The objectives of the proposed research is to prepare novel multi-compositional phosphate-based glasses, determine the correlation among both types of charge carriers, ions and electrons, present in proposed systems. In order to accomplish this, the proposed project is divided into three main interrelated steps. 1. First part will be focused on the conduction mechanisms in phosphate-based glasses that exhibit mixed electronic-ionic conduction. 2. Second part includes study of the influence of the mixed glass former effect on electrical processes in phosphate-based glasses. 3. Third part involves study of the influence of controlled crystallization on electrical transport in selected model glasses from steps 1 and 2. The formation of crystalline grains in a glass matrix can substantially change electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of glass. The idea is to perform systematic studies for understanding the charge transport (ion and electron) dynamics in glasses and glass-ceramics with different crystallinity (from fully amorphous to fully crystallized). The main aim is to determine the universality of the mixed electronic-ionic and mixed glass former effects in proposed glasses. The interactions between glass formers and modifiers, the formation of bonds among them are essential factors that influence the electrical properties of glasses.

Yet, these projects have also uncovered the immense complexity of the animal cell, its potential to differentiate into various tissues, or spiral out of control by forming cancer, opening up even more profound questions on diverse fronts of the life sciences: How does tissue-specific cell differentiation work? How conserved are gene regulation mechanisms throughout animal kingdom? Where does complexity of differentiation originate from? And, finally, what is the origin of multicellularity? Basal metazoans hold key answers to these questions: we propose to tackle them by investigating the non-model organisms at the very base of the animal evolutionary tree – the simplest multicellular animals – sponges (Porifera). Sponges, are probably the earliest branching and the oldest extant animals. They hold remarkable properties that make them an excellent subject for studying developmental gene regulation: a handful of major cell types, no true tissues and organs, and no germ layers, but at the same time they are rich in early developmental genes associated to cancer and possessing totipotent cells. With the aid of comparative genomics and transcriptomics, we wish to explore developmental and cell differentiation processes that we believe are ancestral to all multicellular animals. With a strong collaboration network, expert base in metazoan biology, expertise in genomics and computational biology of complex systems, and a preliminary set of interesting results, we propose to answer the above questions through a truly interdisciplinary approach and elucidate some of the crucial open questions in genomics and evolution of the entire animal kingdom. 					 				|	|Biology|	|gene regulation, genomics, transcriptomics, sponges, cancer genomics|

Hrvoje Jakovac, (dr. sc.) Kristina Grabušić, (dr. sc.) Jonathan Ashwell, |	|Mutations in a widely expressed ubiquitin-binding protein optineurin were recently found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease of unresolved pathogenesis. Unlike most of the other mutated proteins known to cause ALS by their toxic prion-like properties, optineurin is largely thought to cause disease by loss-of-function, arguing for its protective role. In vitro studies proposed that it regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell signaling, autophagy and vesicle trafficking, but their link to neurodegeneration is unknown. ALS is not an autonomous disease of selected neurons. Glial cells including microglia, are essential for neuroinflammation, which greatly shapes disease progression. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the exact role(s) whereby optineurin exerts neuroprotection, pinpoint the cell types in which it acts, and determine its putative effect(s) on the interactions between the cell types relevant for neurodegeneration. We aim to dissect these questions in a stepwise fashion by (1) assessing cell-intrinsic functions in neurons, microglia and macrophages, (2) addressing crosstalk in mix-and-match co-cultures and organotypic spinal cord slices, and (3) verifying these findings in mice. To this end, we have generated a novel disease-mimicking genetic mouse model of optineurin insufficiency. Analyzing the function of optineurin in primary cells and mice models is crucial to the success of this study, given that ubiquitin-binding proteins are prone to in vitro artifacts. Incomplete understanding of ALS pathogenesis is directly mirrored in almost complete inability to treat ALS patients: a single approved drug exerts only a small prolongation in survival. Here, we propose to study a unique ALS model, set apart from the currently available models of direct toxicity by its ability to provide insight into basic neuroprotective mechanisms, thus expectedly paving the way for more successful therapies. 					 				|	|Biology|	|cell signalling, autophagy, microglia, neurodegeneration, animal models|

A great challenge in asynchronous wireless transmission is to accomplish signal detection at the receiver side and to establish multiuser transmission. The proposal of research activities in this project will be the design of low power asynchronous circuits for wireless transmission of analog input signals applicable as sensor nodes in short distance wireless sensor networks. The proposed system can be divided into two major subsystems consisting of the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and the modulator for wireless transmission. Hence, the project activities can be divided into two major phases. The first phase will include asynchronous ADC design, where novel circuit architectures will be investigated, while the second phase will include activities on the modulator design incorporating ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse generators. The asynchronous sigma-delta modulator and various level crossing schemes will be investigated for A/D conversion, while UWB modulation techniques will be considered for the digitized signal modulation. Due to narrow pulse width and duty-cycled operation, UWB modulation techniques are a reasonable choice for the energy efficient wireless transmission. Evaluation of existing and development of new spread spectrum modulation techniques will be carried out to improve energy efficiency. To satisfy the major size and power consumption requirements, the transmission circuitry will be designed in CMOS process. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|wireless transmission, asynchronous analog-to-digital conversion, ultra-wideband modulation techniques, wireless sensor networks, internet of things|

Therefore, our goal is to establish reliable avenues for the design of crystalline metal-containing materials by encoding building-blocks with structural-preferences that lead to ‘programmable’ assembly, thus avoiding serendipity and chance when targeting new materials with specific and tunable properties. To achieve this, we first need to map out the structural landscape that controls how metal complexes communicate and subsequently assemble into 3-D architectures. We will explore and quantify the interrelationship between ligand-field splitting energy, coordination geometry, metal-ligand dimensionality, ligand flexibility, and supramolecular assembly, one variable at a time, using a combination of experiment and theory. This will enable us to map out the structural landscape defined by metal(II) complexes (Co, Ni, Cu and Cd) and custom-made ligands decorated with functionalities that are known to form reliable supramolecular synthons in organic solids. New structural and spectroscopic information will be complemented by data obtained by mining the CSD, while computational methods will inform both the planning as well as the interpretation of the experimental efforts. The results obtained in this systematic and multidisciplinary research program will create new avenues towards the design of crystalline metal-containing materials based on reliable structure-activity protocols. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|crystal engineering, non-covalent interactions, supramolecular architecture, synthons, metal complexes|

Thus, the development of advanced treatment technologies is highly required. Technologies using nanomaterials are one of the fast-growing fields creating variety of new commercial nanoparticles. One of the innovative applications of nanomaterials with a great potential involve their usage as water treatment tools. The photocatalytic treatment using nano-TiO2 as a destructive and “zero” waste method for water purification provides a synergy of advanced oxidation technologies and nanomaterials application with a great potential to be commercialized. However, some features of TiO2 photocatalysis, its mechanical and chemical stability, have to be improved to minimize the potential negative implications. The main goal of NanoWaP project is to develop the sustainable photo-AOT with nanocomposite photocatalysts for the purification of water containing pharmaceuticals. In order to overcome the limitations of nano-TiO2 technologies: agglomeration tendency, post-separation, low activation potential under the sunlight, novel nano-TiO2-based composites with iron-exchanged zeolites and SnS2 will be investigated for degradation of pharmaceuticals in water. The efficiency will be evaluated using an innovative integral approach including: (i) pharmaceuticals removal expressed in a terms of common ecological parameters, (ii) energy consumption per decreased concentration of chosen ecological parameter for one order of magnitude, and (iii) the assessment of adverse environmental effects. Besides, the photocatalysts characterization prior and after the treatment would provide an additional insight in its stability which will be also examined through consecutive runs. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|Water treatment, Advanced oxidation technologies, Photocatalysis, Pharmaceuticals degradation, Nanocomposites, Toxicity|

Despite aggressive treatment of HNSCC patients, which entails surgery, chemo- and radio-therapy, the five-year survival is only 40-50%. Tobacco, alcohol, microbial factors (high-risk human papillomaviruses, hrHPVs), systemic factors (immunosuppression, micronutrient deficiency) and UV-radiation are common risk factors for development of HNSCC. HNSCC patients with HPV infection were found to have better prognosis and treatment response. Besides the HPV status, no adequate biomarkers have been found so far to predict the poor/good clinical outcome nor is the mechanism of how HPV modulates therapy response fully understood. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation of specific gene promoters and posttranscriptional modification of gene expression by specific microRNA (miRNA) seems to be promising biomarkers of disease occurrence and progression. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to identify novel specific epigenetic biomarkers to predict early-stage of HNSCC, notably oral and oropharyngeal cancer, patients at greater risk for developing invasive cancer, and finally understand treatment response in patient with HPV-associated cancers. State-of-the-art technologies, wide-genome microarray assay and types-specific validation of DNA methylation and miRNA profiles (methylome and mirome, respectively) will be used on subsets of healthy tissue, HPV-related and HPV-unrelated precancerous oral lesions, oral and oropharyngeal cancer, and metastasis. The integration of all findings should yield ideal epigenetic biomarkers. This project is a comprehensive interdisciplinary research, which includes basic and clinical research, and will enable the improvement of existing knowledge, development of new technological approaches in diagnostics and prognostics, and possible new treatment approach for oral and oropharyngeal cancer. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|methylation, microRNA, HPV, head and neck cancer, biomarker|

Contrary to antigen binding properties which are defined by nucleotide sequence for its Fab part, effector functions of IgG are mostly regulated by Fc glycosylation, which is regulated by complex interplay of dozens of genes in the IgG glycosylation pathway and different environmental factors. Different clones of B lymphocytes have defined patterns of glycosylation, indicating temporal stability in the glycosylation pathway. DNA CpG methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification and is thus the most prominent candidate for “fixation” of the IgG glycosylation profile in different clones. Our past and current genome wide association studies (GWAS) are identifying complex genetic network which regulates IgG glycosylation. In this project we will use several complementary experimental approaches to identify genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms which regulate IgG glycosylation. IgG glycosylation is relevant in numerous diseases, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Several epigenetic drugs are already used to treat cancer, and many others are developing. Understanding of the role of the epigenetic regulation in IgG glycosylation will provide new targets for the development of new epigenetic drugs and new biomarkers for patient stratification. 					 				|	|Biology|	|DNA methylation, Epigenetics, Histone modifications, IgG, Protein glycosylation, TALENS|

It analyzes it regarding the systems of knowledge or epistemological matrixes and predominant hermeneutic paradigms in the context of European and Anglo-American literary historiography. Research period is delimited by the year 1913, when one of the first overall synthesis of the Croatian literature was published (B. Vodnik, Povijest hrvatske književnosti), and the year 1980, when the first anthropologically implemented theories of literature occur in our academic context. These two extremes, in the periodical sense, are thus interconnected, primarily because of the hermeneutic concepts announced by the early Croatian literary historians, s.a. Vodnik, Prohaska, Hergešić. The goals of this continuous research activity is to analyze: (1) dominant systems of knowledge significant for the development of Croatian literary historiography, s.a. positivism, folk-psychology, psychoanalysis in its Freudian sense, aestheticism, first phase of the responsive theories, applied sociology of literature, early Marxism, formalist, structuralist, stylistic criticism, early poststructuralism, anthropological tendencies; (2) dominant figures of Croatian literary historiography and their methods, derived from their published works, starting from B. Vodnik, D. Prohaska, T. Matić etc., all the way to I. Slamnig, Ž. Jeličić, M. Vaupotić, I. Frangeš, S. Lasić; (3) dominant figures of our literary historiography and their unpublished oeuvres (s.a. Vodnik, Kombol, Prohaska, Matković), which will be published in a critical form; (4) comparative context of this literary historiography, regarding dominant circles in the 20th century (s.a. Czech and Polish circle, Ljubljana school of literary history, German and Italian academic milieu and its influence on the Zagreb stylistics, French structuralism in Croatian milieu). 					 				|	|Philology|	|epistemology, literary history, theory of literary historiography, Marxist literary history, philological approach, textology, stylistic criticism|

The priority will be the essential metals involved in H. pylori metalloproteins. The World Health Organization has declared the H. pylori a Class 1 carcinogen and it is an important target for research due to its pathological relevance. H. pylori requires several accessory proteins such as HypA and HypB for the proper construction of the [Ni,Fe] hydrogenase and urease. The resistance determinants CrdA and CrdB are required for keeping the concentration of free copper ions in the cytoplasm below toxic levels. We plan to clone, express, purify and characterize the complex HypA-HypB and proteins CrdA and CrdB by biophysical and structural methods (thermal stability assay, circular dichroism, determination of copper ion dissociation constant, X-ray diffraction, 3D NMR). We hope to determine how the metallochaperones exert their functions in intracellular nickel delivery (HypA-HypB) and the mechanism of copper level regulation (CrdA, CrdB). The aim of the study of the model complexes (with copper, nickel, iron, zinc and other essential metal ions) is to determine how these metals template their coordination environment by amino acids and their derivatives (N-alkylated, amides, peptides, methionine-rich peptides and others) and to obtain information on the specificity of amino acid or short peptide side chains toward different metal ions. The complexes will be synthesized and structurally characterized by thermal and spectroscopic analysis and X-ray crystal structure diffraction experiments. The conformations of the copper complexes with amino acids will be constructed and the geometry optimized to study their possible equilibrium geometries by quantum chemical calculations. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|esencijalni metali, modelni spojevi, strukturna karakterizacija, proteini iz H. pylori, kemijska sinteza|

The idea of systematic multidisciplinary, environmental monitoring in Croatia appeared in 1965. Based on these ideas, and driven by the growing interest in monitoring changes and dynamics of natural ecosystems, in early 80s the long-term, permanent monitoring plots were established according to the principles of the UNESCO MAB program. Unfortunately, after the initial establishment, these plots were not systematically monitored. Inspired by the need for better understanding of the natural dynamics of forest ecosystems and the long-term monitoring we propose this project with the aim of establishing a long-term scientific monitoring. It includes revitalization of existing and establishment of new monitoring plots which will, in the end, represent a network of field laboratories where current and future researchers would build their research capacities. The project aims to consolidate knowledge and establish a long-term interdisciplinary research with one common goal – understanding and monitoring the dynamics of forest ecosystems. The project is designed on two levels of intensity: 1) extensive monitoring-EM (I) and 2) intensive monitoring-IM (II). EM would result in the 50-60 plots across the Croatia while five of the most representative old-growth forest sites will be the object of IM. IM should serve as a representative object of research for all plots of an EM, while EM enables the estimation of the extent to which the results of the IM case study can be generalized for the habitat type, the geological substrate, vegetation characteristics and the like. This by using relatively quick and inexpensive survey indicators, which show the status of ecosystem. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|extensive monitoring, intensive, old-growth forest, forest dynamic, long-term changes|

Thus, monitoring forest productivity and understanding effects of key environmental drivers becomes essential for forest management. This is a challenging task, particularly due to great costs related to it. Hereby we propose a research, aimed at addressing this issue, with a novel approach that could facilitate fast and cost-effective assessments of forest productivity. The research would be conducted on pedunculate oak forests (Quercus robur L.) which are economically, and ecologically, one of the most important in Croatia. Main objective of the proposed research is to develop and test methods and workflows for the estimation of annual productivity of forests at the local scale by using existing research infrastructure for measurement of carbon fluxes (EC monitoring system), freely available high temporal resolution data from remote sensing (MODIS) and state of the art process model (Biome-BGC). The proposed research will provide the first evaluation on the quality of MODIS GPP and NPP estimates for Central-European lowland forests. Field measurement campaigns combined with state of the art digital photogrammetry will be performed to parameterise Biome-BGC model, and validate data from MODIS and model simulations. Using available data on future climate scenarion, productivity of oak forests for the future 30-50 years will be simulated with Biome-BGC model. The proposed research is in line with the objectives of the EU Forest Action Plan which, among others proposes to encourage adaptation to the effects of climate change (key action 6), and to work toward a European Forest Monitoring System (key action 8). 					 				|	|Forestry|	|forest productivity, Quercus robur, GPP, NPP, eddy covariance, MODIS, Biome-BGC, photogrammetry, dendrometers, soil respiration|

In the first phase of the project realisation, the participants would continue with the broadening and deepening of the theoretical basis of the „new European bioethics“ primarily by completing the research of the life and work of Fritz Jahr and his most important models (Ignaz Bregenzer and others). In the second phase of the project, three focused workshops would be organised determining the status of the general and special ecological needs for the three local communities (Plomin, Bakar, and Mali Lošinj) from the Northern Adriatic region. The three communities selected to host the workshops have either been recently experiencing ecological threats (Plomin – thermo-electric power plant; Bakar – cokery), or represent a highly-valuable and vulnerable natural insular pocket (Mali Lošinj – health tourism, dolphin wildlife refuge, fragrant gardens programme, etc.).

For Croatian history the volumes V, VI and partly VII have the paramount significence.A critical edition and translation of the autograph’ssections of the books V, VI and VII into Croatian language does not exist. HazimŠabanović made translation on the basis of a printed version from 1900 which was done upon an inaccurate, even censored copy. The translator himself had shortened the narrative in many places. Even a brief insight in original text shows dramatical differences and alterations in quantity of text (there is up to 35 percent more text in the autograph) and quality of informations (substantially new informations, thoroughly different from those in Šabanović's translation). The aim of the project is to investigate this „missing link“ among the narrative sources for Croatian history in Early Modern Period, i.e. to scrutinize the autograph, to translate parts of the V, VI and VII book with commentaries and footnotes, and to produce supporting articles. A picture of Croatian societies in different political frames which is given in the Seyahatname has never been a subject of scholarly research. This would lead toward the comprehensive explanation and interpretation of early modern national integration, ecohistorical determinants, social and ethnoconfessional structures and processes. Such a project is expected to contribute substantially to filling the gaps in the historiography, to establish a more balanced perception of the past, along with the improvement of mutual understanding between Croatia and Turkey, with positive effect in the Southeastern Europe.

The novel and still unexplored area of research addressed in this project is to understand how abstract software structures and local system properties influence fault distributions, thus affecting mission critical system properties, among which availability and reliability and to develop innovative approaches for smart management of their operation and evolution. We are facing with completely new phenomena, similar to human evolution, but produced by human intellect.

New findings would open new opportunities in many scientific fields, especially in complex systems theory and its applications, thus interacting with a wide spectrum of sciences, from natural sciences such as biomedicine to social sciences. Industrial experience gathered by systematic Empirical Software Engineering approach is extremely important for further evolution of software engineering discipline. New theories cannot provide effective means for industry without fundamental understanding of EVOSOFT behavior. The main aim of this project is to fulfill this gap between empirical evidence and theoretical models. In that aim we combined empirical and theoretical skills aiming to: • replicate studies and confirm empirical principles and methods and define a solid base to ground new theories, • define structural dependencies for applicability of empirical principles, methods, • define formal models and innovative approaches for smart management. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|evolution, complex software system, smart management, fault distributions, structure|

Dual-fuel engines are modified compression-ignition (Diesel) engines, where CNG is used as the main fuel which is ignited by a small amount of Diesel fuel. Dual-fuel combustion shares characteristics with both compression-ignition and spark-ignition combustion. The use of CNG as a partial supplement for Diesel fuel has been suggested due to the cleaner nature of combustion, its worldwide availability and its potential to reduce both global (CO2) and local (NOx, soot) exhaust gas emissions from piston engines. The main objective of the research is to investigate the possible performance and emissions of an IC engine running under dual-fuel combustion mode. To obtain the boundaries of engine operation the optimization of specific operating parameters will be made in order to take the full advantage of all theoretical benefits of dual-fuel combustion, in the entire engine operating range. Since the initial literature review showed that dual-fuel engines have certain problems at low and high operating loads, special emphasis will be put in research of operating options in these regimes. Therefore, HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) with two fuels (CNG and Diesel) and cold and warm EGR operation will be examined. In order to reach the research objectives, it is necessary to make appropriate modifications on the existing experimental setup. Following the modifications, appropriate experiments will be performed, after which the engine parameters will be optimized with the criteria to maximize the efficiency, while satisfying appropriate exhaust gas emissions. Given the results will be obtained from an experimental setup, the real engine performance will be evaluated by a simulation model that features all necessary engine components but uses the combustion performance data from experimental engine. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|dual-fuel, natural gas, diesel, combustion, optimization, performance, emissions|

FNR is recruited to thylakoid membranes via integral membrane thylakoid rodanese-like protein TROL and soluble Tic62. TROL protein has recently been characterized by our group. FNR also represents a link between light-driven reactions and general metabolism (e.g. carbon fixation, nitrogen metabolism and fatty acid and chlorophyll biosynthesis). In this project, we address the fate of electrons downstream of photosystem I when TROL is absent. We will employ gene knock-out and knock-in approaches in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to study in vivo functions of TROL and its domains. We hypothesize that the interaction of FNR with TROL is dynamic, similar to FNR-Tic62 association, and in synchrony with changing environmental light conditions. Further, we propose that thylakoid lumen-exposed rhodanese domain of TROL is involved in perception of redox signals, while proline-rich swivel preceding FNR membrane attachment motif is responsible for the dynamic FNR biding and/or recruitment of FNR into different membrane domains. We will use elaborate biochemical and biophysical approaches to quantify free radical formation and electron flow and partitioning in various TROL mutants. We will aim to demonstrate that TROL-FNR branch point is integrated into plant stress responses. Finally, we want to demonstrate that the dynamic binding and release of FNR from TROL can control the flow of electrons prior to activation of the pseudo-cyclic electron transfer pathway. This mechanism may have been overlooked in present models of electron flow in oxygenic photosynthesis. 					 				|	|Biology|	|oxygenic photosynthesis, chloroplasts, electron flow, FNR, ROS, rhodanese, protein sorting, transgenic plants, Arabidopsis thaliana|

Hrvoje Mihanović, |	|Using advanced numerical techniques and data assimilation (ROMS 4D-Var) at the same time with modern observations in a dynamically consistent way we aim to improve knowledge of the Adriatic Sea dynamics. During the project we will explore open questions in the field of physical oceanography of the Adriatic Sea: (I) dynamics of the dense water (DW), especially flow at the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea, (II) dynamics of the Po river outflow during stratified and vertically homogeneous conditions, as well as (III) generation and dynamics of the sharp Istrian temperature and salinity front. In order to capture those phenomena we plan to use advanced field observations (ADCPs, CTDs, towed CTD profiler, underway ship CTD), as well as high resolution nested numerical models. This type of measurements could arguably prove hypothesis on the importance of the East Adriatic DW contribution to the overall northern Adriatic DW budget. Measuring synchronously at all important entrances of the Kvarner Bay, we can determine time-evolving dynamics of this socio-economically important region. ROMS 4D-Var system is a powerful tool capable to provide insight into a optimal observation setup, predictability and limits of the linearized adjoint techniques for a shelf sea as the Adriatic. Results from the project could serve as basis for other research fields like ocean biology (DW bringing O2 at the bottom), chemistry or geology, or even applied like oil spills, integrated environmental planning where correct dynamics is of a crucial importance. The project team members come from the four institutions: Ruđer Bošković Institute, Faculty of Science, Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service, and Hydrographic Institute bringing unique competences for the proposed project to succeed. Last but not least, it is important to emphasize that after the project completion, all the insitu collected and model data will be made available to the scientific and applied research community. 					 				|	|Geophysics|	|Physical Oceanography, Data Assimilation, 4D-Var, ADCP, CTD profiler, Po river dynamics, Dense Water Dynamics, Adriatic Sea|

There is growing evidence that continuous environmental discharge of antibiotics and heavy metals contributes to this issue. The selection pressure imposed by these pollutants has promoted the development and spread of antibiotic resistance among environmental bacteria and pathogens. Although pharmaceutical waste is recognized as the most important point source of these pollutants in the receiving aquatic environment, its impact on the composition and antibiotic resistance profile of exposed microbial communities is not known. To fill this important research gap, we propose to take an interdisciplinary approach focusing on freshwater sediments impacted by wastewaters of two local pharmaceutical industries. We will assess the prevalence of antibiotics and heavy metals in these sediments and identify potential hot spots for resistance evolution. Antibiotic resistance genes from hot spots and reference sites will be discovered using functional metagenomics. This will lay the groundwork for a quantitative study that will establish spatio-temporal relationships between industrial discharge and the occurrence of antibiotic resistance. This, in combination with direct capturing of resistance plasmids from sediment bacteria to a model pathogen will be critical to draw conclusions about the spread of resistance genes among bacteria. Complete sequencing of transferable plasmids will furthermore assist in identifying novel plasmids that carry clustered antibiotic and heavy metal resistance gene loci. Finally, the impact of discharge on dynamics of sediment community composition will be analyzed by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. We believe that the obtained knowledge will have vital implications for the development of effective management strategies to reduce the spread of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance determinants via environmental pathways. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|antibiotic resistance, microbial communities, pharmaceutical industry, wastewater, sediment, antibiotics, heavy metals, resistome|

The research objectives will be achieved initially by identifying and developing (i) a comprehensive list of antecedents such as demographic factors (e.g. gender, education), experience factors (e.g. internet use experience, web expertise) and social-psychological factors (values, attitudes), and (ii) a comprehensive list of consequences of online privacy concern on individual-user level. These inputs will be used to develop an extended integrated model of online privacy concern in order to examine conceptual interrelations. Upon building a model, a customized survey questionnaire will be designed and measurement instruments for variables tested. The field research will consist of surveying 2,000 citizens in Croatia to assess their attitudes and behavior patterns when taking different roles and actions in the online environment. This core part of the research aims to empirically test the conceptualized model by employing adequate analytical tools to the large database collected in the survey. The research will result in the final definition of integrated theoretical framework of online privacy concern that will consolidate various streams of research in this field. The extended model of online privacy concern could be applied in future development in the related domain.

A new integrative model of impact of family economic hardship (IMFEH) will be tested in a longitudinal quantitative and qualitative research design. The objectives are: (1) To assess the overall and individual contribution of predictors in IMFEH on adolescents' psychosocial development, where internalized problems, externalized problems, other risk behaviours (alcohol and drug abuse, gambling, risk sexual behaviours) and educational outcomes, including dropp-out, will serve as criterion variables, (2) To compare the efficiency of two models – initial family stress model (FSM) and new IMFEH – in predicting psychosocial and educational problems in the development of male and female adolescents, (3) To identify potential risk and protective factors that moderate the relationship between family economic hardship and adolescents' psychosocial problems and educational outcomes, (4) To investigate the changes in psychosocial risks and school achievement problems during adolescence, and (5) To explore patterns of early leaving secondary education and gain deeper understanding of the process and factors that lead to dropping out of secondary school. Pupils will be followed through 3 waves of data collection (1st, 2nd and 3rd grade). A two-stage disproportionally stratified cluster sample, which will include approximately 1200 pupils and their female caretakers, will be used. The research will be conducted in 6 counties that differ in economic development. 40 adolescents from the initial sample who have dropped out of school during the duration of the study will be recruited. The outcomes of the project will be used to advance the social and family policy measures aimed at reducing the negative effects of family economic hardship on family relations and adolescent adjustment problems. 					 				|	|Social work|	|adolescents, family economic hardship, risk of poverty, externalized problems, internalized problems, risk behaviours, dropping out of school|

The main point of collection and subsequent release of PhACs into the environment are wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), suggesting that their upgrade and implementation of AOPs are required. Once PhACs enter into the environment, partitioning and degradation occur. Degradation of PhACs in the environment or as a result of wastewater treatment can result in degradation products with significantly different physical, chemical and toxic properties even in formation of more toxic compounds. Despite the fact that thousands of PhACs are approved, only a small percentage of them have been studied for presence in the environment. The main objectives of the PharmaFate project are (i) to develop innovative advanced WWTPs based on photochemical AOPs for efficient removal of PhACs and (ii) to achieve an improved understanding of PhACs fate in the environment investigating their photolysis, hydrolysis and sorption. PhACs to be investigated are selected among those identified as high production volume and highly prescribed PhACs, potentially persistent and/or bioaccumulative with no or limited published data on their environmental fate. Proposed treatment technologies include AOPs – photolysis and heterogeneous photocatalysis using nanocrystalline TiO2 based thin films. Degradation mechanisms will be elucidated and degradation products will be identified using advanced analytical methods. Toxicity of PhACs and their degradation products will be assessed. Expected project impacts are in terms of scientific research through creation of new knowledge that will improve our understanding of PhACs fate in the environment and during wastewater treatment, technical improvement of WWTPs and social benefits by preserving the environment. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|pharmaceuticals, degradation products, environment, advanced oxidation process, sol-gel TiO2 films|

The project would encompass five dipeptidyl peptidases III (DPP III): human, yeast, two bacterial orthologs, from thermophile Caldithrix abyssi and oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, and a DPP III from plant Physcomitrella patens. The DPP III cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of many oligopeptides and contributes to the intracellular protein metabolism as well as to endogenous defense against oxidative stress. Human DPP III (h.DPP III) is also related to pathological processes of cataractogenesis, tumor growth and influenza virus infection. The project research should elucidate whether the large flexibility determined for h.DPP III is conserved within DPP IIIs, and how it correlates with the protein function. It would reveal submolecular details important for substrate stabilization and, in the case of h.DPP III, the enzymatic mechanism. Elucidation of the key interactions between h.DPP III and Keap1 protein (Nrf2-Keap1 signalling pathway is major regulator of cytoprotective responses to oxidative and electrophilic stress), and possible correlation of DPP III flexibility with the complex stability, should aid in clarification of its cellular roles. Plant DPP III, differently from DPP IIIs in other organisms possesses a NUDIX box. The project should elucidate its potential dual activity (peptidase and NUDIX). Study of DPP III from thermophile should improve our knowledge on thermophile proteins, potentially useful in biotechnology. In order to fulfill the outlined goals a finely tuned multidisciplinary approach would be used in which molecular biology, biochemistry and mass spectrometry methods would be complemented with bioinformatics, multiscale molecular modeling (coarse grained/all atom MD, QM/MM) and macromolecular crystallography. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|dipeptidyl peptidase III, metallopeptidase, catalytic activity, protein flexibility, MD simulations, QM/MM, H/D exchange, protein interactions|

The stochastic nature of electricity production from RES imposes new challenges for the EPS operation and control. A large share of undispatchable RES can lead to significant disturbances of EPS components. These disturbances need to be balanced out and the security of the system has to be preserved. If the resources for providing balancing energy and flexibility are limited, secure operation of the EPS will become highly expensive. Conventional generation units provide the necessary flexibility to maintain a continuous balance between supply and demand. The question is: are these conventional resources the most feasible way of providing system flexibility in the future low carbon systems? During the recent years, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have become an attractive way of transportation. While passive approach to their integration might cause problems to the system, active utilization of their flexibility might enable higher penetration of RES. A similar reasoning can be applied to the distributed generation, especially technologies with the potential of multi energy vector interaction (efficient electric heating, combined heat and power, battery storage etc.). Current grids need to be capable of dealing with mentioned requirements. The concept of Smart Grid (SG) is based on using of novel information and communication technology (ICT) and includes application of a spectrum of innovative and flexible technologies. The purpose of this project is to establish a methodological and comprehensive framework providing the costs and benefits evaluation of SG projects and technologies. Given the sizeable investments needed, there is a need for a fair, consistent and methodological approach for estimation of the best investment option, taking into account economic and environmental aspects of a specific project. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|energy/power nodes, smart grids, reneawable energy sources, distributed generation, energy storage, plug in electrical vehicles|

Recent studies have confirmed job characteristics as a critical antecedent and a driving force for innovative work behaviour. However, we still know little about how work design factors change over time, how they interact, which are the most important, and how they can be successfully changed. Innovative work behaviour is especially needed and understudied within state-owned enterprises. Their employees are largely unmotivated and unproductive, and organisations are ineffective and non-competitive. Such negative work attitudes and practices hinder innovative work behaviour and result in non-adequate business results. Therefore, the main purpose of the project is to explore the idea of what enhances innovation at the work level. We plan to carry out an in-depth research on work design in Croatia. We will analyse task-, social- and cognitive aspects of jobs within four strategically important state-owned enterprises. Tailored job interventions (e.g., managerial, I-deals, job crafting) will be used in a real life work setting, supplemented with three-way longitudinal diary study and quasi-experimental research design. Through work design interventions, particular set of job characteristics will be modified and aligned with personal- and job-related differences. By achieving a person-job fit, we will be able to foster innovative work behaviour of public employees, and thereby indirectly increase the level of organisational innovativeness. Specifically, the participatory action research applied will provide increased level of idea generation and will result in more frequent process improvements within sampled state-owned enterprises, with a potential spillover effect on other SOEs and significant benefits for the Croatian economy as a whole. 					 				|	|Economy|	|work design, innovative work behaviour, job interventions, state-owned enterprises, longitudinal research, quasi-experiments, weekly diary study|

At the same time, the addition of the masonry wall to the frame tends to increase the base-shear response and reduce the drift capacity of the structure. The increase of lateral force and reduction of drift capacity leads to serious vulnerabilities unless proper proportioning is exercised. For frames with competent walls, the challenge for safe and economical design is to be able to take advantage of the stiffening but to make certain that the increase in lateral forces and reduction in drift capacity do not handicap performance. Available evidence has pointed out that shear strength of the confining column is the ''Achiless's heel'' of the system. Solution of the problem requires understanding the behavior of masonry and concrete subjected to dynamic and random loading reversals, a challenge that demands testing under reasonably realistic conditions for confident analysis of the problem and its generalization. This is a proposal to investigate the safety and behavior of buildings with masonry-infilled r-c frames through near full-scale dynamic earthquake-simulation tests accompanied by supporting pseudo-dynamic tests of structural assemblies and components and by calibrated analytical solutions. The overall goal is to develop pragmatic methods, by cooperative efforts of team members and co-working international body, for design, safety evaluation and standardization. Because framed-masonry serve both architectural and structural demands efficiently, people in seismic regions live and will continue to live in buildings of this type. An organized solution of the safety of such construction is essential. This proposal intends to put the ''framed-masonry'' composite up as a full-fledged building type, it is ''transformative'' and will change design practice. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|r/c frames, masonry infill, behavior, safety, modelling, standardization, framed-masonry|

FRAMNAT will involve a dynamic team of young scholars and develop innovative methodologies for cultural memory research and cognitive linguistics analysis relevant for Croatia’s academic and policy-making community, as well as a much broader transnational audience. Croatia’s commemorative culture regarding the wars of the 20th century serves as a platform for politicians to operate within the nation-building narratives. Our project will analyze both top-down and bottom-up strategies of framing the nation and collective identities through commemorative practices of World War Two and the Homeland War in Croatia. These discourses will be analyzed at three levels: top-down political discourse (elites), media representation and transmission, and the reception of the narratives in Croatian society (bottom-up reactions). Seven commemorations related to World War 2 and the Homeland War will be observed and analyzed using corpus-based linguistic analysis and frame analysis. The media representations of the commemorative events and opinion poll data will likewise be analyzed in order to map how these discourses are transmitted and received in Croatian society. The project results will be disseminated via a regularly updated website (which includes a database of the collected research materials), journal articles, an edited volume, and papers presented at international conferences. Students and other members of the scholarly community will be encouraged to participate in the project through a variety of workshops to be held at the University of Rijeka.

The more specific goal of our project is to produce original contributions in some central areas of research into free will, in the following disciplines: metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics, history of philosophy, philosophy of physics, as well in philosophical interpretations of relevant results of psychology and neuroscience. The most specific goals of the research are the following. First, we plan to show that deterministic threats to free will are surmountable. Second, we plan to show that indeterministic threats (i.e. those based on randomness and luck) are also surmountable. Third, we will argue that some problems with compatibilistic accounts are more serious than has hitherto been recognized. This is due, first, to the fact that, in our opinion, compatibilism is also susceptible to a specific luck objection, and second, to the fact that it is sometimes based on insufficiently clear notions of causality, determinism and natural laws. Fourth, we will argue that Aristotelian version of compatibilism can bring some fresh light to contemporary discussions, but that it is also susceptible to a specific luck objection. Research activities can be grouped under five main headings: 1. Causality, laws of nature and luck (1.1. Causality, laws of nature and action; 1.2. Indeterminism and luck; 1.3. The varieties of determinism), 2. Brain, mind and agency (2.1. Freedom and consciousness, 2.2. Mental causation and ascriptions of intentionality, 2.3. Some perspectives from neuroscience), 3.

Yet, in contrast to the rich and fruitful field of cw-laser-induced optomechanics, the investigations of mechanical action on atoms due to interaction with trains of ultrashort laser pulses (i.e. frequency combs) are scarce in literature. Meanwhile, recent results made in our group have indicated that in a specific excitation geometry an entirely new type of FC-atom interaction emerges that calls out for further experimental and theoretical investigation. The aim of the project is to explore novel phenomena that arise when the mechanical action on cold atoms is induced by frequency comb (FC) excitation, including entanglement and decoherence, near-resonance dipole trap, and frequency-comb-induced cavity cooling. The proposed research will open up several intriguing topics in the field of research that is relevant to the scientific community worldwide.

In order to be able to understand societal development it is therefore necessary to understand school legislation and educational institutions which, through secondary socialisation, reproduced the desirable normative frameworks for the society within which they operated. Proto-modernisation and modernisation processes implemented during the 18th and 19th centuries were of key importance for forming the school system as an educational system that became an important factor in the emergence of modern civil societies. A research into the problem area of the school system requires a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that differs essentially from the researches undertaken thus far and closed within the boundaries of the discipline. The objectives of this project proposal are to determine, using modern methodological approaches and critically analyzing archival material, factors that were of crucial importance in the process of creation and functioning of Croatia’s school system and for the influence this system exerted, to evaluate correlation of Croatia’s school system with the school system in the Habsburg Monarchy and its reflection on the network of power in the society in the period of (proto)modernisation. The project will result in three volumes of documents that were of crucial importance for the development of Croatia's school system, internet database on students studying at higher schools in the Monarchy, interactive map of educational institutions, a workshop for doctoral students, international scientific conference and an exhibition in the Croatian School Museum. One of the objectives of the project is to create prerequisites for expanding international cooperation and including various topics of history of Croatia's education in internationally funded projects. 					 				|	|History|	|History of Education, Intellectual Transfer, Secularisation, Modernisation, State Education Policy, Habsburg Monarchy|

The incidence of childhood stroke as reported by population based studies is 1.23-13.0/100 000 children/year. More than 100 risk factors for stroke are recognized but genetic factors are incompletely characterized. FV Leiden, FII 20210G&gt;A, MTHFR 677C&gt;T, protein C deficiency and elevated Lp(a) have been demonstrated to play a role in childhood stroke. It is likely that stroke in children occurs secondary to interactions between several genes and the environment that, together with age-related differences in cerebrovascular, neurological and coagulation systems limit the direct extrapolation of research from adults to children and justify research of polymorphisms of other thrombophilic factors. The aim of this investigation is to determine the prevalence of genetic risk factors in a cohort of children with ischemic stroke by analysis of polymorphisms in i) coagulation factors FV (FV Leiden and FV H1299R), FII (20210G&gt;A), FXIII (Val34Leu), ß-fibrinogen (-455G&gt;A) and PAI-1 4G/5G; ii) platelet glycoprotein receptors GPIa (807C&gt;T/873G&gt;A and 52T&gt;C), GPIba (1018C&gt;T, VNTR and (-5)C/T Kozak), GPIIb/IIIa (1565T&gt;C – PIA1/A2 and 2622T&gt;G) and GPVI (13254T&gt;C); iii) P-selectin (S290N, N562D, V599L, T715P) and iv) intermediate risk factors for childhood stroke, ACE I/D and Apo E2/E3/E4. The obtained results will enhance knowledge about involvement of other genetic risk factors in the etiology of ischemic stroke in childhood. The understanding of genetic basis of ischemic stroke will contribute to the development and application of standardized protocols for the diagnosis, investigation, therapy and outcome assessment of ischemic stroke in children. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|ischemic stroke, genetic polymorphisms, thrombophilia, children, coagulation|

The OLA project involved research material derived from a special survey carried out in 853 settlements, the result of which was an extremely rich dialectological registry. The material collected does not confirm the traditional view of the disintegration of the Proto-Slavic language, instead showing that the disintegration process of the Slavic whole was much more complex. This is seen in isoglosses that cut Slavic territory into the most highly differing directions. This is proof that particular Slavic groups in various historical periods found themselves in complex relationships amongst themselves and that were constantly changing for economic, political, or cultural reasons. Linguistic material for ALE was collected using a special survey carried out in a majority of European countries, including 15 Croatian survey points. The project also involves the etymological and onomasiological interpretation of linguistic material from all European survey points. This project of linguistic atlases provides world dialectology with organised data on the phonetic, phonological, morphological and lexical systems of a large number of languages and dialects, and enables the well-founded study of the linguistic development of European languages. Croatian material is presented and interpreted, and the linguistic relationships between data from the dialects researched is confirmed. Conclusions are drawn on the history and development of languages, on the relationships between them, and thus on the relationships of the Croatian language towards neighbouring and distant dialects. This will provide material for comparative genetic and typological research of linguistic systems in the Slavic and non-Slavic world. These synchronic and diachronic relationships will be presented in the OLA and ALE books and atlases in the form of maps and commentary. 					 				|	|Philology|	|dialectology, linguistic atlas, linguistic maps, slavic languages, european languages|

A hypothesis common to all research directions aiming at understanding the quantum theory of gravity is that our description of space-time geometry has to go beyond the classical picture of space-time as a differentiable manifold. Within this project we are interested in generalized concepts of geometry, physically motivated by string theory: generalized complex geometry and non-commutative geometry. We aim at improving our understanding on how these generalized notions of geometry could be utilized to obtain consistent extensions of symmetry principles. In particular, we are interested in extending the gauge principle, the key physical notion used to describe all (known) matter interactions, in view of the above generalizations of classical geometry. Our goal is to capture the effects of string duality symmetries, non-commutative gauge theory and higher gauge theories at the level of the effective field theory description, which is necessary in order to perform reliable calculations and yield experimentally testable predictions. We expect that geometrizing these generalized symmetries would provide us, as a long-term perspective, with a consistent framework within which one could address open issues in cosmology and black-hole physics. 					 				|	|Physics|	|generalized complex geometry, non-commutative geometry, gauge theory, matrix models, fuzzy spaces|

However, the increased mineral content in the diet does not guarantee increased mineral status for consumers and consequently mineral malnutrition is one of the global health concerns. Phytic acid (PA) acts as antinutritive compound by binding mineral cations and forming mixed salts. PA is also the main storage molecule for phosphorus and it is essential for normal seed development and germination. Seed mineral and PA content varies widely among bean genotypes. In Croatia bean is traditionally grown in low input production systems. The production is based on landraces which are adapted to local environments and display high levels of morphological diversity. A broad variability is also expected in seed bioactive nutrient content as well as on genetic level. Through international collaboration on Phaseolus genomics, a lot of information has become available including genetic linkage maps, microsatellite databases and a massive number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sequences. In proposed project an integrated approach will be used to characterize bioactive nutrient variability and the inherent genetic diversity. In conjunction with a detailed data on bioactive nutrient content, a whole genome association mapping analysis will be carried out in order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to bioactive nutrient content. Success in bean breeding for higher quality relies on the availability of information on bioactive nutrient content and the knowledge of genetic bases of quality trait variability. The integration of fundamental (molecular genetics) and applied (plant nutrition, plant breeding) sciences will facilitate the management of traditional landraces as sources of bioactive nutrients in future breeding programs based on marker-assisted selection (MAS). 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|Phaseolus vulgaris L., nutrients, bioactive substances, molecular markers, genetic diversity, association mapping|

The synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD), are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of a-synuclein (aSyn). Studies on the rare inherited forms of PD caused by mutations in the aSyn gene have highlighted disturbed aSyn clearance through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) as a key mechanism leading to PD/LBD. Furthermore, several rare inherited disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal genes show parkinsonian-like phenotype and accumulation of aSyn, providing additional evidence for the role of lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. The goal of the project is to elucidate the involvement of lysosomal gene mutations and lysosomal dysfunction in the ethiology of PD/LBD. Using the next-generation sequencing and Haloplex-based protocol we will design LYSOGENE platform to anayze genetic mutations/variations in the ALP genes that may lead to and predispose to PD/LBD. The identified ALP mutations will be further characterized in vitro in human neuronal cell lines using the knockdown and overexpression approaches. In particular, we will monitor how the identified mutations affect ALP function, accumulation and aggregation of aSyn, as well as neurotoxicity. Finally, we will validate our mechanistic findings in a biologically relevant model of human dopaminergic neurons derived from the PD/LBD patient’s fibroblasts using the induced pluripotent stem cell technology. Through these studies we will identify genetic variations/mutations in the ALP genes that cause or contribute to PD/LBD. The results of the project may help to identify potential new therapeutic targets for development of neuroprotective treatments. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Parkinson's Disease, alpha synuclein, next-generation sequencing, lysosomal dysfunction, iPSC|

Maize as a major crop worldwide is essential for industry and is cultivated mostly in rain-fed cropping systems where changes in climate or diminishing water supply take place. Grain yield, the most important trait in maize as a composite trait is influenced by many stress-related traits. The main goal of this project is to elucidate and integrate common genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying the multiple-stress tolerance in maize. The specific aims are to detect genetic and physiological factors responsible for plant response to high plant density, drought, Diabrotica and Fusarium attacks as well as cadmium excess in soil in testcrosses of two maize populations (reference IBM population and a doubled haploid population) and their respective parents. By investigating root and leaf characteristics including chlorophyll fluorescence and other stress parameters as reliable indicators of stress in four-year field and pot experiments conducted in Croatia and Turkey, DNA marker-assisted selection and genomic selection could accelerate maize breeding for yield, abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. A multidisciplinary approach, which ties together breeding, physiology and molecular genetics, can bring a synergistic understanding to the response of maize to multiple stresses. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|drought, diabrotica, plant density, cadmium excess, genomic selection|

The most frequent form of AITD is Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) that is characterised by progressive destruction of thyroid tissue. Many studies tried to unravel genetic contribution to HT development in the past few decades but with low success. The breakthrough of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) tremendously increased the rate of detecting novel associations. However, HT has been unrepresented in the GWAS mostly because of the lack of large cohorts of HT patients and the performance of such study is a matter of urgency. We plan to recruit 500 HT patients and to create a DNA/serum/plasma biobank of deeply phenotyped HT patients that will serve as a powerful resource for current and future investigations. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants underlying HT by performing the first GWAS focusing on HT exclusively. We will use newly recruited HT patients and 500 existing controls (from the “10,000 Dalmatians” study) in case-control GWAS and validate observed associations in an independent replication cohort. To further help in elucidating genetic contribution to HT we will perform pathway analysis and gene-interaction analysis using variety of environmental factors and medical records that will be collected from HT patients. We will also perform deep phenotype characterisation of HT patients that may provide additional clues about HT aetiology. This is timely planned study that aims to generate new knowledge that will advance our understanding of the genetic basis and underlying biological mechanisms of HT. This knowledge will be crucial in guiding the development of new prevention, diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Other benefits of this project include promotion of collaboration, transfer of knowledge, building of infrastructure and it will help in establishment of independent research carrier of principal investigator. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Hashimoto thyroiditis, thyroid gland, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS), statistical genetics, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), biobank|

Paramyxoviruses are RNA viruses with a single-stranded negative sense genome. They have been isolated from a wide variety of species, demonstrating a vast host range and great viral genetic diversity. These ubiquitous pathogens are among the most common causatives of respiratory tract infections and are responsible for a high degree of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The biology of RNA viruses is influenced by their high potential of continuous evolution. Because of the error-prone nature of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and large population sizes, RNA viruses show high levels of genetic diversity. Mutations can significantly influence virus biological properties and lead to appearance of new strains. The knowledge of viral evolution depends on the amount of genomic data available for analysis. We propose the research of viral genomics of wild type paramyxoviruses currently circulating in Croatia. It is our goal to increase the number of genetically well characterized paramyxoviral wild-type strains. The proposed work will add to knowledge about paramyxoviral ecology, variability and evolutionary capacities. As molecular epidemiologic monitoring of circulating wild type viruses enables analysis of current relations between existing viral genotypes, it is an invaluable part of virus surveillance and control, facilitating the detection of endemic areas, estimations of vaccine efficacies and predications of possible outbreaks. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Paramyxoviruses, molecular evolution, genomics, virus genotype, molecular epidemiology|

Nevertheless this phenomenon might be very important and help explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe: our Universe consists of matter, with the negligible amount of antimatter. Despite many attempts a satisfactory explanation for this asymmetry is not yet at hand, although it is generally accepted that the processes responsible for it must violate CP. The qualifying aim of this project is to explore the idea that CP violation may be traced back to gravity. However we believe it is more effective to cope with this problem in the framework of a more general research on parity violating effects in gravity, which we will study by means of modern methods of exploring the gravitational interaction: holography, Kerr black hole horizon-conformal field theory (Kerr-CFT) correspondence, trace anomalies, entanglement entropy, fluid-gravity correspondence. The focus will be in particular on the natural candidates for parity violating gravity processes - the Chern-Simons terms, both pure gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational ones - using extra-dimension models inspired by the string theory. The expected outcome is a significant increase in understanding the consequences of parity violating gravitational interactions, not only in relation with possible CP violations, but also for other effects, e.g. for corrections to black hole entropy. 					 				|	|Physics|	|gravity, black holes, parity violation, quantum anomalies, holography, string theory, conformal symmetry, entanglement entropy|

Accordingly, as a promising alternative to traditional organic solvents from both the environmental and technological perspectives, neoteric solvents (neoteric = new, recent, modern), ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), have been dramatically expanding in popularity as a new generation of designer solvents with possible applications in various industrial fields. The aim of proposed Project is to gain an in-depth understanding of the natural ILs and DESs with fine-tuned properties, as well as to implement these solvents into food technology, biotechnology and chemical technology. Within the Project ILs and DESs, based on renewable sources such as cholinium salts, sugars, organic acids and amino acids, will be prepared and characterized, followed by examination of their applicability as solvents for extraction of phenolic compounds from wine and oil by-product, in biocatalytic reactions and in fuel purification process. To our knowledge, in the Republic of Croatia we are the only research group involved in multidisciplinary and systematic approach in the investigation of ILs and DESs. Thus, proposed Project would enable our further research in the field of preparation, characterization and application of these new green solvents, which is of great importance for Croatian academic community in order to successfully follow the EU directives. Additionally, knowledge gained through proposed Project will profile us as the leading group in the field of natural ILs and DESs research, both in the Republic of Croatia and EU, for fostering knowledge transfer to academia and potential industry partners. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|biocatalysis, biologically active compounds, deep euectic solvents, fuel purification, ionic liquids|

One of its major objectives is to develop efficient solvent-free and low-energy preparative methods for various classes of existing and new chemicals. The feasibility of this green-chemistry concept will be demonstrated on the synthesis of organopalladium complexes and the majority of synthetic steps in this project will be performed in the solid state by methods of accelerated aging and mechanochemistry. The first mechanosynthesis of organopalladium compounds via C-H bond activation, which is of exceptional importance in organic synthesis, by palladium(II) acetate has been recently reported by our group. Within this project we propose to develop and implement the solid-state methods for the synthesis of a series of cyclopalladated aromatic azo compounds. Interest in such complexes with conjugated C=C and N=N bonds arises from their strong absorption and emission in the low energy region, which qualifies them as good candidates for the biomolecular labels. In this regard, their affinity to target amino acids, short peptides and nucleobases will be studied by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. Consequently, an additional benefit of this project will be a series of new chromogenic and fluorogenic chemosensors. The solid-state structures of the products will be determined by X-ray diffraction, NMR, Raman and IR spectroscopies. The cyclopalladation mechanism in the solid state will be studied by in situ monitoring of the reactions using Raman spectroscopy, and in the solution by UV-vis and NMR spectroscopies along with the ESI mass spectrometry. The optical characteristics of complexes will be evaluated by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. The experimental results will be rationalized by theoretical studies in order to explain isomerism of complexes, the nature of their electronic transitions and to obtain additional support for the cyclopalladation mechanism. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|mechanochemistry, aging, C-H bond activation, organopalladium, mechanism, spectroscopy, non-invasive chromogenic and fluorogenic chemosensors|

Reliable ship speed loss estimation under real environmental conditions allows a more accurate prediction of the power increase and fuel consumption as well as gas emissions from ships. Nowadays this second issue becomes very important because of the problem of global warming. Following the increasing awareness of the environmental and human health concerns of shipping, legislative actions have been taken on global and national levels making mandatory (from January 1st 2013) that new ships over 400 gross tonnage, to comply with the regulations, should have emissions of CO2 under limiting value. Technological enhancement to ships like improved hull designs as well as improvement in power and propulsion systems could potentially reduce CO2 emission up to 35 %. These measures could effectively be combined with several other operational measures, such as weather routing and voyage planning, in order to ensure that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from ships are minimized on every voyage. The proposed research will be conducted in three main areas: 1. Improvement of the methodology of ship speed, fuel consumption and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (especially CO2) calculation on actual weather conditions, 2. Optimization of the ship hull (bow and stern) and ship propulsion system operating in actual weather condition, 3. Optimization of ship route by taking into account all relevant parameters: weather prediction, attainable ship speed on waves, main engine performance and navigation constrains. The objective is to improve ship design and performance taking into accounts the environmental issue, creating a so called eco-efficient or “green” ship design. The project team consists of the scientists who are experts in the naval architecture, mechanical engineering and marine engineering field which allow solving this problem multidisciplinary. 					 				|	|Naval architecture|	|seakeeping, ship speed, ship resistance, ship propulsion, fuel consumption, GHG emission, weather routing|

They consist of extremely complex structure defining by triple phases: slow porous medium, mostly laminar fractures and usually fast turbulent conduits/karst channels. Usually, karst aquifers have been analyzed by lumped hydrological models which ignore high heterogeneity of karst and consider only input (precipitation) and output (spring discharge) due to lack of extensive other input data and knowledge regarding the karst system. Last two decades full hydraulic (distributive) models have been developed exclusively by conventional finite elements considering karst heterogeneity structure that improves our understanding of complex processes in karst. Therefore, in this project we will develop novel “unique” flow model based on multi-resolution approach originally designed by Gotovac et al. (2007-2013) for 1-D and 2-D groundwater flow and transport simulations. Proposed approach is based on Fup basis functions with compact support and meshless collocation procedure enabling multi-scale representation of heterogeneity and other flow variables, closely related to the karst flow physical interpretation. Moreover, extending existing procedure to 3-D and constructing separate multi-scale solution for all three karst phases, proposed approach will enable the following impacts in comparison to conventional methods: desired spatial and temporal accuracy and high computational efficiency, modular model structure, incorporation of different heterogeneity scales related to existing measurements, enabling of transport and tracer test analysis and better understanding of karst aquifers due to solving of different engineering problems such as water usage and protection or contaminant pollution. Flow model will be verified by laboratory experiments and numerical synthetic benchmarks as well as real examples such as Jadro catchment and Ombla underground accumulation. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|karst aquifers, groundwater flow modeling, multiresolution and multiscale approach, karst heterogeneity, distributive karst models|

Examples of cultural/architectural and landscape heritage in Croatia are numerous, valuable and diverse. Part of this heritage is recognised worldwide and is protected by UNESCO. Croatia’s most valuable heritage is protected at a national level, although a part of it has, as yet, not been recognised. For various reasons the numerous examples of Croatian heritage are in a poor condition and decaying because they don’t have a permanent use and are not included in the life of cities and towns, despite being formally protected. In former research project, Urban and Landscape Heritage of Croatia as Part of European Culture, cultural heritage was researched in an attempt to present its values and traits as part of Croatia’s national identity and culture. The new project proposal partly supplements previous project thematically and uses results of this research, but the focus of research is on the creative, sustainable and responsible usage of urban, architectural and landscape heritage, which is a non-renewable resource. Contemporary attitudes of conservationists on the holistic protection based on international conservation documents connect protection with urban and regional planning through the concept of sustainable development. The aim of proposed research is to affirm heritage as an active space and spatial resource, to include it in future life and to allow it to be the initiator and active participant in sustainable spatial, social and cultural, economic and touristic development. The research will be based on the selected case studies for each type of cultural heritage. The aim is to define spatial criteria, methods and models for revitalisation and for the implementation of new projects within cultural heritage which may contribute to their enhancement. The project results (criteria, methods, models) will be applied in spatial and urban planning and conservation practices, and will be of far-reaching impact. 					 				|	|Architecture and Urban Environment|	|Cultural Heritage, Urban Planning, Spatial Planning, Heritage Enhancement, Heritage Revival|

The project addresses an interdisciplinary research and combines fundamental and applied research activities in chemical, electrical and environmental engineering fields. The highest possible scientific and technological impact of the project is supposed to be ensured by joining of the human and experimental resources of several different Croatian’s groups. The novel, high power-high energy electrochemical supercapacitor device will be based on hybridization of two different types of electrodes (double-layer and pseudo-capacitive) in a respective electrolyte. Various forms of carbon and carbon based binary and ternary composites with transition metal oxides and/or conducting polymers will be tested as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. For being competitive in the area of energy storage, the tested electrodes should fulfil the requirements of high specific capacitance, long cycle-life, good charge/discharge efficiency, low self discharge and adequate operating voltage. The project is planned to be realized mostly on the basis of fundamental experimental research directed towards increasing of the basic knowledge comprising choice of material, proper design of electrodes and careful elucidation of all underlying physical and chemical processes at active electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The results of fundamental experimental research will be utilized for selection of proper electrodes, their arrangement into electrochemical supercapacitor device, optimization of device to the energy content and power ability, testing of device in practical environment and implementation of device into hybrid electrical vehicle. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|Supercapacitors, electrochemical energy sources, electric vehicles, renewable energy, carbon electrodes, conducting polymers|

The ultimate goal of the proposed experiments, together with other experimental and theoretical investigations, is to provide crucial pieces of information for the understanding how hadrons emerge from their fundamental constituents - the quarks and gluons, why the colour is confined, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the nucleon is much heavier than its constituents. The main objectives in electron scattering experiments at MAMI are: cross section determination of the p(e,e’ ?+)n reaction at Q2=0.078 (GeV/c)2, the lowest measured value till now, of crucial relevance for axial nucleon form factor determination, measurements of virtual Compton scattering in the momentum transfer range of relevance for nucleon structure determination, investigations of 12C(e,epp)10Be and simultaneous measurement of 12C(e,epp)10Be and 12C(e,e’pn)10B reactions of relevance for determination of the role of quark degrees of freedom in nuclei and also for understanding of cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars. The main objectives in the kaonic atoms experiments at LNF are: upgrade of SIDDHARTA setup in order to reach desired resolution and subsequently high precision measurements of transitions in kaonic deuterium, 3He and 4He, that should yield isospin dependent kaon-nucleon scattering lengths. Their precise determination will put strong constraints on the low-energy kaon-nucleon dynamics and eventually constrain the SU(3) description of chiral symmetry breaking.

It will explore how in the multilingual imperial space of intensive cultural exchange and economic mobility the interethnic and social tensions were shaped by (trans)-intercultural communication and practices, both from above and from below. It focuses on accounts of plural belongings and hybrid identities that are geographically grounded, socio-economically situated and embedded in cultural and linguistic practices manifested by multilingualism and intercultural competence of social scripts and behaviour. The project will cover spatially and regionally confined patterns of interaction in the Croatian part of Istria, and the cities of Pula and Zadar under direct Habsburg influence and in the cities of Rijeka and Zagreb, politically bound to the Hungarian part of the Empire during the period 1870-1918. The main strains of research will focus on uncovering discourses produced through three social spaces, those of institutions (administration and education), associations (cultural, sport), and those visible in everyday life, through consumption practices and tourism. The analyses will encompass social practices in different domains of life, symbolic system (focusing on language) and the use of artifacts, or material life.

Lett. 39, 5010, 2014). In such conditions, the standard CCD recordings of digital holograms suffer from the lack of information, since they are either obscured by noise or flattened by the bit depth conversion. We have shown that by using a photon counting detector (PCD) instead of a CCD sensor and by employing high dynamic range of the PCD, the original information can be efficiently preserved. We are motivated to extend the previous research to other holography and interferometry techniques as well as to perform contextual experiments and experiments in high-sensitivity interferometry. As a result of this project, the specialized photon counting detectors and direct laser hologram writing technique will be also developed. Main tasks of the project include: (i) Investigation of the role of the experimental parameters for recording the time-averaged and pulsed digital holograms under weak illumination. Expected results are: finding the optimum range of main recording parameters (beam ratio, exposure time, SNR, contrast) and experimental limitations due to coupling of various frequencies (surface vibrations, laser pulse, repetition rate of PCD). (ii) Implementation of contextual experiments by means of photon polarization and orbital angular momentum. Expected result is to demonstrate quantum contextuality in a four-dimensional Hilbert space in a new way different from previous. (iii) Investigation of a quantum effect of a photon buildup in a Fabry-Perot cavity by employing high-sensitivity interferometry. Expected result is to demonstrate that only quantum theory can explain the distribution of events within a given time window. (iv) Developments of the specialized photon counting detectors and direct laser writing of holograms technique. 					 				|	|Physics|	|holography, digital holography, interferometry, numerical holograms, photon counting, quantum contextuality|

We are interested in how advancing knowledge within practice can contribute to the development of innovative scientific methodologies. The concept of performativity has long been discussed within the social sciences and the humanities (in language philosophy, performance theory, gender studies, ethnography, anthropology, etc.). Performance is a new paradigm, not so much a new art form; it stands less for a new phenomenon than for a new observation of familiar phenomena. Here it becomes not only a subject for study but also an interpretive grid laid upon the process of study itself (Carlson). With growing interest in the interface between art, science, technology and society, the role of the performative act within scientific practice and knowledge production receives more attention these days. In the contemporary European context the idea of “performative science” is enriched with new technological approaches and systems science insight into the problem of performance complexity. The main purpose of our research is in giving new scope to exploring the dynamics of exchange in artistic ”creation”, as well as in the study and representation of lives. An important hypothesis, connected to this purpose is to prove that the dynamics of methodology transfer between arts and sciences, the methodological “interactive continuum” (Newman &amp; Benz) and its “feedback loops” facilitate maximizing the strength of both methodologies. In order to contribute to clarification of stated theoretical and methodological problems, collaborators coming from different fields of research will try to develop, verify, validate and use in simulations, the formal models for quantification of dynamics of exchanges within performances: system dynamics model and agent based model. 					 				|	|Arts|	|practice-led research, artistic performance, performing arts, dynamics of exchange, methodology transfer, systems modelling|

This process is regulated by a network of genes, many of which show pleiotropy with different diseases. Glycans present a great potential diagnostic tool as well as contribute to the understanding of the aetiology of diseases. The importance of glycosylation in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) has not been addressed by now. T1D is a form of diabetes that results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Lack of care for these patients can be lethal, so any new knowledge about the development of this disease would represent an important contribution. Integrating glycomic changes with the subjects’ known genotypes could generate powerful and important results, potentially defining groups based on their glycome and genomic characteristics. This information may also be used to predict an unaffected individual’s risk of disease. This is why, in this study, we will combine expertise in genetic analysis and analyses of plasma glycome in order to search for the glycomic changes that are specific to T1D and for which we can correlate glycome and genome. To reach the goals of this study, we will analyze plasma glycomes of families with both diabetic siblings and unaffected siblings. Due to the age-related changes in glycosylation, parents will not be included in this study, so over 4500 samples will be analysed. All these samples have their genotyping performed. Glycomes will be analysed using MALDI-TOF-MS technology, which provides reliable analysis and presents the best available glycoanalytic tool. Thus, due to the undeniable role of glycans in pathological conditions, the well characterized population selected for this study and the use of highly modern and sensitive technology, this study will result in important new insights that will advance the comprehension and management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. 					 				|	|Pharmaceutical sciences|	|glycosylation, type 1 diabetes, gycome, genome, predisposition|

Through its research objectives, the project will investigate networking aspects of human-centric communication, such as the allocation and optimization of cloud and network resources and also providing related quality of service guarantees. This research will be used as a building block for various smart services, which enable user and device adaptation based on learning from previous situations and communicating the results of these situations. This powerful concept relies on new methods in cloud computing for big data processing and Internet-connected objects, such as smart sensors and actuators, as well machine-to-machine communication between devices using self-organizing ad-hoc networks. Smart services are further built upon innovative complex-service composition methodology and intelligent mechanisms to be formulated by the project. The introduction of smart services will drive the changes in the way people interact with devices towards more intuitive and unconstrained means. In particular, contactless user interaction, considering various categories of users, and networked virtual worlds/environments will be studied. Network data traffic models and network management will be proposed, including online charging mechanisms for dynamic pricing and cost calculation of smart services. The research proposed in this project will create new knowledge, strengthen research mentoring and improve young scientist capacities in Croatia, contribute results to science in the area of Information and Communication Technology, and help develop Croatian scientific and research space as one of the long-term strategic priorities, enabling knowledge transfer to Croatian economy for the benefit of society. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|smart network, big data, cloud communications, human computer interface, internet of things|

We have also developed ideas and gained knowledge and experience for further experimental treatments of our samples aimed on development of new properties competitive for specific applications. The project addresses fundamental physics and chemistry, properties and application of silicon hybrid nanostructures prepared by electrochemical anodisation and low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD). The project proposal consists of four interrelated research tasks: silicon/hybrid nanostructures for gas sensing; low light infrared detection; surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in food technology and spherical optical microresonators in low concentration molecular detection. The proposed tasks are mutually interconnected by the CMOS technology compatible materials production based on inexpensive silicon, and by the search for their specific advanced applications. For the achievement of the proposed research tasks we have organized a team of 14 researchers (9 scientists and 5 PhD students) from 2 scientific institutions, 2 faculties and 1 institution in the private sector and 2 renowned institutions from abroad. Electrochemical processes will be used for construction of tailored pore sizes and volumes in silicon that are controllable on the scale from nano- to micrometers. A number of suitable chemistries will be applied for the functionalization of porous Si surfaces for gas sensing, IR sensors and SERS spectroscopy. The novel silicon heterostructures deposited by the LPCVD method on silica spherical optical microresonators will be investigated for possible applications in molecular sensing. The structural, optical and electrical properties of such functional silicon nanostructures will be examined from the fundamental science point of view as well as for development of specific high-tech products needed by the Croatian industry. 					 				|	|Physics|	|SILICON, NANOSTRUCTURES, SENSORS, HYBRID COMPONENTS, ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTORS|

However, they are scarcely investigated in non-mammalian species, and not adequately addressed in the field of environmental toxicology.

Thyroid hormones act on every tissue regulating cellular development, differentiation and metabolism. Parathyroid hormones control the amount of calcium in the blood. The expression of thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies is under polygenic control and influenced by environmental factors. The aim of this study is to identify genetic loci that are associated with levels of thyroid/parathyroid hormones and antibodies that will advance our understanding of the genetic basis of their function and thus provide additional knowledge relevant to clinical outcomes. We will perform genome-wide association analysis of thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies on 1,000 individuals from Split region (participants from the 10,001 Dalmatians project). The thyroid and parathyroid hormones/antibodies that are planned to be analysed are: free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, thyroid microsomal antibody titer, thyroglobulin antibody titer and parathiroid hormone. In addition, detailed anamnestic data and phenotype measurements already taken from study participants will be used in realization of second and third project objectives: investigation of relevant gene-environment interactions and determination of phenotype-phenotype correlation. We plan to follow-up interesting findings in additional 2,000 individuals and in datasets sought through international collaboration. Outcomes of such comprehensive approach will be generation of a new knowledge of genetic background, gene-environment interaction and phenotype-phenotype correlation associated with thyroid and parathyroid function that will lead to better understanding of biological pathways and clinically relevant disorders related to their function.

Due to prolonged therapy materials and techniques for prevention and regeneration of damaged enamel and oral tissues are concurrently used. Oral cavity can be considered as a galvanic cell, where saliva is electrolyte and dental alloys and oral agents are galvanic coupling components. Decreasing elasticity of orthodontic wires due to intraoral corrosion can produce excessive forces and therefore can disturb regeneration of tissues and irreparable damage to root and surrounding periodontium and bone. Due to long-term exposure corrosive products are released into adjacent tissues, saliva and blood. There from a number of undesired side effects can develop. Nowadays, the allergies occur more often and onset earlier during a lifetime. Children and young adolescents are undergoing pubertal growth, changes and maturation of immune system and particular attention should be paid to their exposure. Nickel has been well known allergen, present in many dental alloys. Nickel allergic hypersensitivity occurs in up to 28.5% of the population and it cannot be considered a low potential risk. Lately, allergic reactions to titanium were reported in patients with endoprosthesis and dental implants, contrary to the previously established biocompatibility. The occurrence of an allergy to titanium could be responsible for successive unexplained cases of failure of dental implants. Nickel and titan can enhance resistance of some bacteria to antibiotics which can produce problems in treatment of several infections that are more common in children and adolescents.

The Roma is an example of a founder population with centuries long sociocultural isolation which left traces in their gene pool which shows considerable differences compared with other populations. The genes that significantly differentiate among populations are those responsible for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs (ADME genes). The knowledge on their distribution in isolated populations is limited. Therefore, in this application we propose to study ADME genes' polymorphisms through the analysis of ADME core markers and CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 genes in 300 DNA samples obtained from three Roma groups in Croatia. The general objective of this project is to determine the variation of ADME genes in Roma population, to assess the extent to which the population history which includes multiple bottleneck/founder events, isolation and endogamy impacted this important gene family. This will be achieved through population structure analysis, the assessment of the age of mutations and in silico functional analysis. We expect to find specific allele distributions of the investigated loci within the ADME genes, landmarks that reflect the Indian origin of the Roma and the signals of admixture with the populations they came in close contact with in the past during their migration from India to Europe. Our assessment of Roma’ unique genetic profile will contribute to the medical practice through the modulation of pharmacotherapy in Roma population. It will also significantly contribute to the field of pharmacogenetics in terms of information on the genetic variation in Roma, essential for the development of pharmacogenetic tests specific for this minority population estimated to around 15 million people. The results promise to highlight the population uniqueness in ADME genes and encourage similar research in the world’s isolates. 					 				|	|Biology|	|ADME genes, Roma, isolation, population structure, polymorphisms, CYP2D6, CYP1A2|

The presence of multiple phases causes a series of limitations, primarily connected to transport phenomena and actually those limitations are the ones that cause their distinct kinetic determination. Due to the complexity and the wide range of heterogeneous processes, research would be limited to solid-liquid systems, taking place in agitated batch reactors. Two heterogeneous processes are to be investigated simultaneously, one that includes and one that excludes a chemical reaction (a. Batch cooling crystallization; b. Ion exchange of heavy metals). The base intention of the proposed project is to find a link between process parameters, hydrodynamic conditions in agitated batch reactor, process kinetics and characteristics of the final product (that is, final process result). Furthermore, the intention is to examine the mentioned relation as a function of reactor scale size as well. Considering the kinetic determination of the process, special attention will be given to the investigation of the influence of hydrodynamic conditions, i.e. the influence of the mixing operation in a batch reactor on the kinetics of the investigated processes. Since one of the goals of this project is to contribute to the theory of reactor design, experimentally obtained insights could represent the criteria basis of heterogeneous solid-liquid process equipment scale up as well as the basis for the mathematical modeling of the impact of operating conditions on the heterogeneous process result. This way the functional relations between studied variables would be established. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|heterogeneous process, batch reactor, process parameters, mixing, kinetics, crystallization, ion exchange, heavy metals, mathematical modeling|

Furthermore, HS diet has a direct effect on endothelial activation under atherogenic shear stress, promoting the endothelial-leukocyte interactions in ApoE-/-mice.Oxidative stress underlies inflammatory processes in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our previous studies demonstrated that RAS suppression by HS diet underlies impaired endothelium-dependant vasorelaxation due to increased oxidative stress and due to the shift in the production of vasoreactive metabolites of arachidonic acid. Infusion of subpressor doses of angiotensin II restored normal vasorelaxation. However, involvement of the RAS in development of early atherosclerosis is only emerging. In this project we will test the hypothesis that restoration of the RAS (by infusions of subpressor doses of angiotensin II) decreases endothelial activation and abolishes endothelial-leukocyte interactions (ELI) by eliminating oxidative stress and the production of proinflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid. We will use normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that exhibit suppression of the RAS with HS intake and in TFF3-/- transgenic mice. TFF3-/- mice are complete novelty in this research approach, and promising new model for studying the atherosclerotic lesion formation and proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, due to their protective phenotype of favorable ratio of ?6/?-3 fatty acids and modified metabolism of arachidonic acid. Aim 1: to elucidate the effect of RAS restoration on the mechanisms of flow-mediated responses in animals on HS diet. Aim 2: to determine the effect of RAS restoration on endothelial cells and leukocytes interactions. The results may provide evidence for the shift in the paradigm that the RAS is always detrimental to circulation and support the new paradigm of crucial role of normally modulated RAS in prevention of atherosclerotic lesion formation 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|vasorelaxation, high salt diet, endothelial-leukocyte interaction, angiotensin II, atherosclerotic lesion, TFF3-/-mice|

In the focus of this project are conditional reasoning measures of implicit personality that represent “a model for psychometric, conceptual, and theory based implicit association measurement” (Landy, 2008, p. 390). This measurement system is called conditional reasoning because it is based on the assumption that an individual’s reasoning is conditional on his/her personality and that these differences in reasoning can be measured with inductive reasoning tasks capturing unconscious cognitive biases that stem from individuals’ personality motives. The project aims to further advance the knowledge about the conditional reasoning method of personality measurement, and the relationship between (implicit) personality and work behavior by exploring implicit aggression and power motive. We plan to (1) test the implicit nature of conditional reasoning tests and the strength of their relationship with other implicit personality measures intended to assess similar constructs; (2) further explore the relationship between the conditional reasoning tests and work behavior by testing mediators and moderators of that relationship; (3) study how different measures of implicit and explicit personality assessing the same construct (i.e., aggressiveness and power motive) interact in explaining work behaviors. We plan to focus on aggressiveness and power motive because they have the pivotal role in explaining very important aspects of work behavior such as counterproductive work behavior and leadership. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|implicit personality, work behavior, conditional reasoning, aggressiveness, power motive.|

HCV productively infects hepatocytes to impart liver inflammation and progressive tissue damage leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. These processes underlie liver dysfunction and are thought to drive the onset of liver cancer. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which HCV confers hepatic inflammation are not defined. Now, there is growing evidence that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and Kupffer cells (KC), may play key roles in regulating immune responses and facilitating tolerance induction. These cells are playing a pivotal role in blood-borne virus clearance (&gt;90%), leaving only a small fraction of infectious virus that escapes clearance in a manner peculiar to each individual pathogen. The biology of HCV, specifically regarding non-parenchymal liver cells, has been largely neglected. LSEC account for the 20% and KC for 15% of the hepatic cells, and are a unique organ-resident cell population with diverse functions, including degradation of bacterial by-products, antigen presentation and induction of tolerance. The hypothesis of the research is that HCV infection reprograms cellular gene expression of LSEC and KC, which results in the modulation of the inflammatory responses. Applying the infectomics approach, we plan to perform a series of next-generation sequencing experiments on LSEC and KC isolated and purified from healthy, mild and severe chronic hepatitis C liver biopsies. This will allow us to detect expression changes related with disease progression. Selected candidate genes will be comprehensively studied in in vitro systems in order to elucidate their role in modulation of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. Through the development of this project it is expected that a series of high impact results will be obtained, which will facilitate the development of more significant biomarkers and effective interventions against HCV infection. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|HCV, gene expression, Kupffer cells, LSEC, inflammation, immunotolerance|

The purpose of the project is to develop new types of creep models applicable to new types of steel and aluminium alloys and to conduct the analysis of the influence of creep strain on the behaviour of steel and aluminium columns, which represent the most sensitive parts of the whole structure during collapse stage. The initial stage of the project covers conducting tests for determining stationary creep curves. The curves would be obtained on different temperature and stress levels with the purpose of creating new types of analytical/rheological creep models. The developed creep models are intended to be implemented into two research codes developed by the PI's host institution and by the institution of the external member of the project team. The codes will subsequently be used for numerical modelling of the behaviour of steel and aluminium columns influenced by creep. Following the implementation of the creep models, fire tests which cover testing of steel and aluminium columns exposed to different load and temperature levels are planned, including transient heating curves which would induce significant development of creep strain in the columns. In the final stage of the project verification of the developed creep models is planned using columns’ fire test results. A new insight into the behaviour of steel and aluminium columns under creep influence would be obtained including the insight into types of fire heating scenarios causing a significant increase of creep strain. Conclusions obtained on the basis of the performed tests would be suitable for creating new set of design rules for steel and aluminium structures in fire. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|steel, aluminium, fire, creep, rheological model, analytical model, column, coupon|

Magnetism is a quantum phenomenon emerging from the superexchange interactions between magnetic moments in the material. Understanding how these interactions bring forth a material with specific magnetic properties is one of the key questions in materials science. In low-dimensional quantum spin systems the interactions between the spins are often described by the isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The importance of weak anisotropic interactions emerges from experiments and requires new theoretical treatments. These interactions are found to induce new interesting phenomena with great potential for applications in emerging technologies. Exploiting new methods sensitive to these interactions is thus crucial. Aim of this project is to experimentally investigate the influence of magnetic anisotropy on chosen quantum spin systems by combining two highly sensitive techniques: torque magnetometry and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Our study is focused on samples with magnetism coming from electron spin S=1/2, which can be classified as weakly interacting small spin clusters, quasi one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets and/or magnetoelectrics. The combination of mentioned techniques allows a new methodology for investigation of the influence of magnetic anisotropy on quantum spin systems and other magnetic materials and will provide important input in understanding of anisotropy induced phenomena. Within this project a collaboration between physicists and a chemist will be established with the purpose of synthesising new high-quality magnetic materials. Our study will focus on these materials, and on samples synthesized in expert laboratories abroad. The main aim of this project is to form a new independent research group highly qualified to investigate the anisotropy induced phenomena in new promising magnetic materials. 					 				|	|Physics|	|Quantum spin systems, low-dimensional magnets, magnetic anisotropy, torque magnetometry, esr spectroscopy|

The advection of different water masses into the Adriatic is potentially one of the main factors affecting the Adriatic ecosystem. The major potential modes of influence of BiOs on the Adriatic ecosystem are: i) by changing buoyancy content in the South Adriatic which drives the winter convective mixing processes; ii) through impact on the autotrophic biomass due to the change in nutrient availability; iii) by bringing different types of allochthonous organisms into the Adriatic and Ionian Sea. The goal of this project is to determine the magnitude of the impact of alternate advection of water masses on the pelagic ecosystem of the South Adriatic, primarily through tracking the changes in plankton communities, which are the first to react in the ecosystem because of their short life cycle and position in the food chain. We will apply phylogeographic methods, which include the usage of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers, in order to determine the origin of alien species entering the Adriatic and to assess the influence of BiOS on genetic composition of Adriatic zooplankton communities through the advection of individuals from different parts of Mediterranean basin. The exact mechanisms of influence of the entering water masses on production of the Adriatic are poorly known. Its comprehension could allow forecasting of small pelagic fish catches which could serve as a basis for sustainable management of the fisheries, an important part of Croatian economy. 					 				|	|Biology|	|Plankton, alien species, thermohaline circulations, BIOS mechanism, long-term changes, South Adriatic, East Mediteranean|

A broad spectrum of HFRS clinical conditions has been recognized, ranging from inapparent or mild to a fulminant hemorrhagic process with severe renal failure and death. The strong proinflammatory response during acute infection in humans is probably responsible for viral clearance but also for potentially fatal proinflammatory-mediated disease. Innate immunity is the first line of defense to various pathogens which may substantially determine the further development and outcome of disease. There is strong lack of knowledge on innate immune response to HTV in acute phase of disease and no evidence on immune response to reinfection with HTV at all. Overall objective of this project is to identify some key elements of innate immune response in acute HFRS infection and in experimentally simulated HTV reinfection at the level of monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, their crosstalk, “memory” and potential mediation by microRNAs (miRNAs). For that purpose, ex vivo experiments on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes/macrophages and NK cells will be performed in patients with acute HFRS and patients previously encountered HFRS. Primary monocytes/macrophages and NK cells will be additionally infected with HTV and co-cultivated. In order to asses potential miRNAs role, some inhibition experiments will be performed. Computational analysis will follow all experimental process in order to generate new data, pursue study in right direction and indicate important signaling pathways for the future research. Such concept may represent the next step in the design of future vaccines for HTV. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|hantavirses, Puumala, Dobrava, reoinfection, acute infection, monovytes, macrophages, NK cells, innate immunity, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome|

Our research is an extension of the present green campus multidisciplinary research and development. It belongs in the architecture domain, but it also includes interdisciplinary participation from other professions. We refer to the university campus Borongaj in Zagreb as an explicit framework of our research. The plan is to build it as a green campus with the highest level of energy efficiency. In its full form, that campus should be a place for studying, working, learning and living for about 20,000 academic citizens. For that reason, it was necessary to design a complex system and implement cutting-edge green technology and energy efficiency principles: bioclimatic principles of renewable energy sources, advanced technology, smart systems, and user adoptation of the new environment and technology within the methodology of the living laboratory concept. In the proposed three year project the team would research new materials, building elements and construction methods to define those appropriate for implementation. Using Building Information Management software and sustainable design principles the team will develop alternative building proposals that will be analyzed based on detailed energy, cost/benefit and quality of life simulations. The input from the construction industry is also planned. The third phase of the project is a testing phase in which, through student surveys and direct input from a selected group of students, the team expects to refine the proposals. In the end the research result needs to be evaluated within the high expectations of the green campus concept. 					 				|	|Architecture and Urban Environment|	|Architecture, Campus, Green technology, Sustainable Development, Innovative Design|

This new type of industry is based on Smart Factory model or Smart Enterprise. The main features of Smart Enterprise can be summarized into the following: smart personalized product, product and service provider, and high level of collaboration. Manufacturing is today, as it always has been, a cornerstone of the economy of developed nations. An important advantage of manufacturing is that it calls on the skills of everyone from entry-level factory workers to scientists, engineers, and business professionals. Hence, main focus of this project will be Manufacturing Enterprises. Vision of Innovative Smart Enterprise for next generation manufacturing can be summarized into following features: Lean, Flexible, Agile, Efficient, Responsive, Information Enabled, Predictive, and Safe. All these features result with long term sustainability. The main objective of this project is to develop Croatian model of Innovative Smart Enterprise (HR-ISE model). Hence, a profound research will be performed to describe current state of Croatian manufacturing enterprise. It will be the answer on the question: “Where are we?” Furthermore, a synthesis of analysis of Croatian manufacturing enterprises will be done through development of HR-ISE model. It will be the answer on the question: “Where we want to be?” Finally, a special learning environment will be established: Learning Factory. It will be a place in which transfer of developed HR-ISE model to the economy subjects will be achieved. It will be the answer on the question: “How can we get there?” Results of this project will be of the highest value for “fallen” Croatian industry. The development of HR-ISE model and its transfer to economy can have strong impact on recovery of Croatian industry, and it can significantly improve competencies and capabilities of Croatian enterprises. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|innovation, smart enterprise, learning factory, production systems, business model|

A unique context of the study is provided by setting the research in the context of minority and majority schooling, where teaching is provided in either majority (Croatian) or minority languages (Italian, Serbian, Czech and Hungarian). Inclusion of multiple minority communities simultaneously makes this project sample rather unique. Intergroup threat (symbolic, realistic and intergroup anxiety) and especially social norms are hypothesized as being key mechanisms of influence of the interethnic contact. A novelty of the research is in encompassing multiple aspects of intergroup threat as mediating mechanisms in the link between intergroup contact and intergroup attitudes and behaviors, as well as and in assessing major sources of influence in adolescence – parental, peer and school norms. Participants will be majority and minority (Italian, Serb, Czech and Hungary) elementary and high-school students in Croatia, aged 12-17 (N=1200) and their parents (N=2400). The research combines qualitative and quantitative approach. Qualitative methods (focus groups, interviews and also observations) will be used to get an in-depth insight in the explicit and implicit contact-related school norms. These data will be used further for designing an instrument for measuring contact-related school norms. Quantitative data will be collected in a two-wave longitudinal study, and the effects of interethnic contact on ideological (assimilationism and multiculturalism) and intergroup attitudes and behaviors will be followed. It is proposed to test under what conditions, how and what social norms influence the link between the contact and intergroup attitudes and behaviors and what is the role of the intergroup threat in this context. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|social integration, majority and minority relations, interethnic contact, intergroup threat, social norms, minority education|

We will focus on service-level interoperability and we will use lightweight semantic language and AI planning methods to resolve found problems of heterogeneous things abstracted in form of semantic web services. Our idea is to represent things as services and semantically annotate them by using lightweight semantic language such as SA-WSDL. OWL Ontology for describing the things and their most important operations will be developed. Things as services will be annotated using the developed ontology, together with their main operations and operations’ input and output. AI planning problem and domain will be formulated to enable composition of various things as services. Then an AI tool together with web interface will be developed to enable users to achieve more complex tasks composing various things and their capabilities. We will investigate how we can integrate our approach with existing cloud computing services, i.e. we will develop a framework for integration of clouds and Internet of Things. Cloud services can enrich things as service with storage, application and resource capabilities. Therefore, cloud services will be semantically annotated using similar approach as semantically annotated smart things.

Understanding its structure and function is of the highest importance in biology, and also crucial from biomedical point of view. Functional centromeres are marked by centromere-specific histone H3-like proteins (CenH3). Centromere identity involves both genomic and epigenetic mechanisms, favoring rapid co-evolution and species specificity of CenH3 and associated DNA sequences without impairing the function. Complexity and variations make perception of centromere genomics still fragmental and worked out only in a few most common plant and animal model systems. Among invertebrates, sequenced genomes of model organisms with diverse constitution of centromeric regions became recently available. Tribolium beetles have centromeres embedded deeply into the satellite DNA-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin, Meloidogyne root-knot nematodes have holocentric chromosomes, while the mollusk Crassostrea gigas lacks uniform distribution of satellite DNAs in centromeres. The main goal of this research proposal is to identify CenH3 and CenH3-associated DNA sequences as well as their non-functional genomic counterparts in order to explore genomics of differently organized centromeres. In addition, organizational and evolutional aspects of CenH3 and centromeric DNA sequences will be addressed. The research strategy will combine CenH3 identification, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based assays using anti-CenH3 antibodies, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunofluorescence in situ localization (IF) and the bioinformatics pipeline. Such integrative approach will help filling the gaps in functionally essential regions of sequenced genomes and will forward our understanding of the synergy and coevolution between DNA sequences and protein components in the centromeres. 					 				|	|Biology|	|centromere, CenH3, satellite DNA, repetitive DNA, evolution, beetles, nematodes, molluscs|

These plans are, however, in contrast with the EU fiscal policies which are faced with constraints as regards deficits and public debts. Public spending on education should, therefore, be given special attention. This research project, consequently, has three main goals, which are as follows: to analyse the relationship between public spending on education and GDP growth; to investigate whether there is a convergence between public spending on education among the EU countries and to analyse the efficiency of public spending on education in the EU countries. 					 				|	|Economy|	|PUBLIC SPENDING, EDUCATION, GROWTH, CONVERGENCE, EFFICIENCY|

The pathological remodelling occurring in ischemic myocardium gradually leads to chronic contractile dysfunction and affects many intracellular mechanisms participating in energy production, calcium homeostasis and apoptosis. In the current project, we propose to investigate these pathological processes in patients suffering from the CAD. Patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery will be included and will undergo a detailed cardiac evaluation, which, in addition to standard diagnostic tools, will be enriched by the advanced diagnostic techniques still non-existing in Croatia (stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging). This will provide accurate identification and quantification of regional myocardial ischemia. Following clinical evaluation and during revascularization surgery, left ventricular biopsies will be taken from characterized ischemic regions, as well as from non-ischemic regions, and a detailed analysis of intracellular energy metabolism, calcium-contractility and endoplasmic reticulum stress will be performed. The Specific Aims of the project are: Aim #1 is to assess regional myocardial perfusion and function in patients with CAD who are considered for revascularization therapy. Aim #2 will investigate pathological processes affecting mitochondria, calcium homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum stress that take place in the ischemic parts of myocardium. Aim #3 is to evaluate the effects of the heart rate-lowering pharmacological therapy on ischemic myocardium. Thus, the overreaching aim of this proposal is to investigate intracellular mechanisms underlying myocardial adaptation and remodelling in chronic ischemia and to identify predictors of outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing revascularization therapy. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|myocardial ischemia, chronic heart failure, cardiac bioenergetics, cardiomyocyte pathophysiology, cardiac imaging|

The main aim of this research is to identify the characteristics of the school leadership practice in Croatian schools with the special emphasize on indicators of both solo and distributive leadership and finding those features that are associated with the school and student achievement. The main aim will be elaborated through the following specific tasks: 1) examining the characteristics of school leadership with special emphasis on the role of participation and interaction of individual stakeholders in the activities of leadership (school principals, school boards, school councils, professional services, teachers, parents, students, community representatives and local government) and their association with indicators of school success; 2) examining various features of education system governance from the perspectives of different stakeholders (communication and collaboration between state level, local governments and school level authorities; overall satisfaction with the education system governance) and their effects on the school leadership practice. Results of the previous studies and preliminary review related to Croatian education system point to the importance of strengthening the characteristics of the distributed school leadership with special emphasis on strengthening the capacity of teachers as active participants in making key decisions related to the matters of education. 					 				|	|Pedagogy|	|governance of educational system, distributive school leadership, school effectiveness, local educational authorities, school principals, teachers, sc|

Iodine deficiency (ID) has many adverse effects on growth and development, the most important being mental impairment in children. The most susceptible groups include pregnant women and children. In the past, Croatia was region of severe ID with presence of cretinism. Due to persistence of mild to moderate ID, new regulation on universal salt iodination (USI) was introduced in Croatia in 1996 with 25 mg potassium iodide per kg of salt, thus reaching iodine sufficiency. Investigations performen in 2009 confirmed iodine sufficiency. However, median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in schoolchildren has been rising, while pregnant women had borderline sufficient median UIC. The study will assess iodine intake and monitor USI program to determine whether it provides sufficient iodine intake. The hypothesis is that USI program in Croatia provides sufficient iodine intake in pregnancy and schoolchildren except for pregnant women with salt restriction. A total of 1000 schoolchildren and 500 pregnant women from four regions of Croatia will be included in the investigation. Methods in schoolchildren comprise measurements of UIC, thyroid volumes by ultrasound (Tvol), iodine content in salt and questionnaire. Methods in pregnant women comprise measurements of UIC, Tvol, serum FT4, TSH, thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid antibodies and questionnaire. Pregnant women will be classified into four groups according to salt restriction and consumption of iodine rich supplements. Value of serum Tg as a marker of ID in pregnancy will be determined. Evaluation of iodine rich supplements will be performed in relation to iodine content. The results of the study would enable USI program management and publication of guidelines regarding consumption of iodine rich supplements in pregnancy and to regulate iodine content in food and supplements as well as assess the value of Tg as a biomarker of ID in pregnancy. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|iodine intake, pregnant women, schoolchildren, salt iodination, prevention, thyroid|

A common denominator for both aspects are the methods used to study them: social interaction can be descibed and simulated using agent-based models (ABM social science perspective) whilst distributed AI is commonly modelled in terms of multi-agent systems (MAS computer science perspective). The important question to ask in both perspectives is how do agents organize in order to perform their tasks and reach their objectives? Herein we will employ a combined empirical and theoretical approach towards finding the answer to this question. From the empirical side, we shall study the human behaviour on a number of venues across various gaming servers in order to find most suitable structures, cultures, processes, strategies and dynamics employed by most successful player communities. From the theoretical side, we shall test a multitude of organizational architectures from organization theory in various MMORPG settings, and compare them with methods found in empirical research. Our research is therefore aimed towards enriching the organizational design methods for the development of MMORPG to foster the development of self-organizing and adaptable networks of large-scale multi-agent systems. With this in mind, our main goals are: 1) To identify and formalize adequate organizational design methods for developing LSMAS in MMORPGs. 2) To couple them with real-life and future scenarios from industry. 3) To provide open and accessible tools, which will allow for design, development, implementation, control, simulation and maintenance of LSMAS in MMORPG. 					 				|	|Information and communication sciences|	|large-scale multi-agent systems, agent based modeling, mmorpg, organizational methods, organizational design, artificial intelligence|

Nikša Krstulović, |	|Cold and low-density plasmas are currently in focus of basic research worldwide due to many open questions regarding their complex nature and simultaneously due to their high potential for applications in various fields of research and technology. Plasmas can be produced by bombarding matter either with energetic electrons or with energetic photons. The first kind is related to use of various discharges and the second to use of powerful lasers. Our interest is in plasmas produced in vacuum, under low-pressure gas environment, at atmospheric air or on/within liquids. Discharges which we use range from electrodeless, single electrode to various designs of two electrode systems. Lasers we use are cw or pulsed nanosecond. In our research special care will be devoted to tailoring the electron energy distribution functions as a key factor influencing plasma content and features. This is usually done by changing macroscopic plasma parameters - gas pressure, electrical fields and geometry of discharges. In this project we shall combine laser produced plasmas with discharge plasmas to achieve that goal. To understand the complex nature of plasma or processes of plasma interaction with other matter phases (gases, liquids and solids) basic approach is to perform plasma diagnostics by various types of optical and laser spectroscopies. To interpret findings we study basic atomic collision processes in plasmas and structure and spectra of various complexes formed within plasma (dimers, radicals etc). Modeling of various processes within cold plasmas and laser produced plasmas is performed in addition. In various applications in which plasma treatment of matter is used there is a need for in situ monitoring of processes both in plasma and at interfaces and therefore both spatial and temporal spectral resolution of applied detection techniques are important. We use classical emission and absorption laser spectroscopies and modern techniques such as a cavity ring-down spectroscopy. 					 				|	|Physics|	|low temperature plasmas, laser produced plasmas, cold plasmas, atmospherics plasmas, laser spectroscopy|

We shall seek correlations between skeletal and artifactual evidence, which should allow us to recognize regularities and possible discrepancies linked to a specific gender or age group. Our primary aim is to investigate the variability of mortuary practices as reflected in modes of corpse treatment and disposal. At a more general level, we shall combine our data in order to investigate LBA social identities in southern Carpathian Basin. Our second aim is to investigate whether the traditionally perceived difference between 'Urnfield culture' and 'Belegiš II group' can be detected in mortuary evidence other than urns. Our sample of 120 burials covers a time span of six centuries, which will allow us to monitor the diversity of mortuary practices during the entire LBA and also contribute to the resolution of regional chronology. In order to archive the data, as well as to distribute and promote our findings, we shall design a public-access data base, organize a round table with experts from region and publish our results in a monograph. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Late Bronze Age, mortuary practices, society, archaeology, anthropology, southern Carpathian Basin|

The latter is an inevitable result of new EU competitors entering the Croatian market. Cross-border and/or domestic corporate regrouping may take different forms depending on the chosen legal model. While being multi-layered phenomena, corporate acquisitions and restructurings are covered by several specialized legal disciplines which the contemporary legal doctrine does not observe as a whole. The aim of this research is to combine the various legal aspects of corporate acquisitions focusing on knowledge driven companies’ restructuring as the most beneficial model. Accordingly, the proposed research will analyze legal models of corporate acquisitions, financing techniques, taxation issues, intellectual property and related competition law concerns, covering thus the topic from the point of company law, capital market law, tax law, competition law and intellectual property law. The research will combine the legislative, judicial and theoretical analysis with the relevant empirical analysis. Cross-referenced results in the respective fields and their systemization will enable the creation of scientifically founded and empirically tested legislative proposals in one single-package. The aim is to enhance the level of protection of all interested parties of corporate acquisitions and knowledge driven restructurings either via strengthening ex ante and/ or ex post control. The results will be disseminated to the legislator, regulators, judiciary and companies as ultimate beneficiaries. What more, project results will enable companies to optimize their choices of restructuring and their position on the market. The dissemination of the project results will ultimately promote and develop knowledge driven restructuring that should in turn increase the competitiveness of the Croatian companies and stimulate the overall economic growth. 					 				|	|Law|	|corporate acquisitions, mergers, takeovers, concentrations, taxation of corporate acquisitions, knowledge based restructuring|

Croatia, M.S. v. Croatia and A.K. and L. v. Croatia). The Court concluded that current legal regulations and practice governing the prevention of violence against mentally disabled persons, their power to instigate criminal proceedings without explicit guardian's consent and divestment of parental rights have violated the Article 3 and 8 of the Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Court decisions present a clear warning that rights of people with mental difficulties have not been adequately protected in Croatia and that there is a need for substantial reform of the laws regulating their legal status. Bearing this in mind, the Project is designed to critically analyse current legal regulations in the light of already accepted high international standards and to conduct empirical research at four county courts with the widest jurisdiction in order to evaluate whether the regulations are adequately applied in practice. Analytical and empirical results will be used as a valid basis to create a new Bill on Protection of Persons with Mental Difficulties as the main legal instrument to regulating the legal status of this especially vulnerable group. In order to facilitate application of the new Law in practice and to make a concrete impact on real position of people with mental health issues, the project will seek to organise seminars, round table discussions and workshops for mental health lawyers and psychiatrists. By its in-depth research approach in interdisciplinary settings, the ultimate Project goal is to improve and promote rights of people with mental disability and increase their empowerment, enabling them to enjoy full citizenship on an equal basis with other members of Croatian society. 					 				|	|Law|	|people with mental disorders, legal status, actual position, interdisciplinary perspective, European standards|

This data, after its initial usage, is most commonly archived and used only in aggregate forms for condensed reports. We propose a pilot project called eduMINE, in which we will apply data mining methods and algorithms on this data to discover potentially interesting patterns and other information hidden within, following recent reasearch accomplishments from the field of EDM (Educational Data Mining). Test scores, customized concept maps and other available data will serve as input for the data mining process. Results of these methods will then be integrated with the existing e-learning support information system with the intention to provide a useful feedback to the lecturers, both regarding the course lectures generation and adaptation as well as generation of well balanced and objective tests. Results should also aim to help with early identification of students who are in danger of failing a course. It is important to emphasize that all team members of this research proposal have extensive experience in methods of data analysis and have developed and published research papers describing new algorithms and measures used for certain data mining approaches. Furthermore, the team has plenty of direct experience in education, most of it concerning large first and second-year college-level courses taken by over 600 students yearly. We are confident that given enough time and resources we can offer solutions which would result in further enhance the quality of education and be applicable not just in the specific domain we are directly involved in, but in any similar education environment. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|educational data mining, e-learning, data analysis, , concept maps, service-oriented, behavior modelling|

The properties of such systems can be described only by taking into account collective phenomena governed by strong and competing interactions, often leading to frustrations. The subtle interplay of interactions is, in turn, a key ingredient for extraordinary complex phase diagrams exhibited by SCES. Even more interesting are regions of instabilities away from stable phases. The way a new phase emerges close to a phase boundary reveals hidden properties of the studied system. It is extremely important to understand how symmetry breaks in the transition itself and identify the space and time-scales relevant for the changes of order parameter within the transition. Sometimes an intermediate state emerges between two stable phases, bringing new physics to light. This project aims to study some of these new, mostly unexplored states that emerge between well explored stable phases in SCES, or as a consequence of some kind of frustration. In order to obtain a complete picture of new states of matter we will combine several advanced experimental methods: nuclear magnetic and quadrupolar resonance (NMR and NQR) as an atomic-scale, local probe, and nonlinear conductivity as a mesoscopic probe of electronic physics. We will be able to systematically study the many phases and transitions in SCES, provide answers to some currently burning questions, and significantly advance our knowledge about them. In particular, we will study charge order in novel superconductors, and spin liquid and spin nematic states in frustrated quantum spin systems. The project will fully employ the new broadband NMR laboratory in Zagreb, strengthen its visibility and international collaborations, and enable finishing of three PhD theses. 					 				|	|Physics|	|nuclear magnetic resonance, microwaves, cuprates, pnictides, frustrated spin systems, charge order|

A possible intensional origin of classical logical laws will be examined. Concepts will be approached in first-order and type-theoretical setting as well. One hypothesis to be examined is that intensional logic and logical concepts can be described in terms of objectivity and (according to Gödel’s hypothesis) in terms of causality. 2) The intensional nature of some fundamental ontological concepts will be examined on the example of the new formalization of Bolzano’s ontological theory, in comparison Leibniz's ontology. The research will focus on the concepts of substance, adherence/inherence, and whole-part. 3) The contribution of concepts to the objective value of knowledge is aimed to be shown, especially in mathematics, and starting from Frege’s theory of concepts. Especially, the interrelationship of the conceptual and objectual content in analytic and first-order propositions will be investigated. 4) The causal role of logical concepts and language in the context of their use in speech acts and argumentative dialogue will be analysed. Pragmatics will be shown to be an essential constituent part of logic, which is, like syntax and semantics, apt to be rigorously formalized. In addition, the research aims to show that the use of logic and language is a primary source of the description of concepts. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|logic, concept, ontology, knowledge, pragmatics, Kant, Bolzano, Frege|

The project will attempt to reconstruct the specific karst lake landscapes and their surroundings in view of environmental and climate change and human migration from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through the Holocene. LoLADRIA will provide long, high resolution, paleohydrological reconstructions from a region extremely sensitive to changes in effective moisture and atmospheric dynamics. The multiproxy-based reconstructed curves will provide new data to identify and date the main climate events, and to characterize the climate variability at century and millennium scale since the LGM. Pollen and ostracods offer the possibility to develop transfer functions in order to reconstruct quantitative changes in regional climate and hydrological conditions of the lakes. LoLADRIA will offer an environmental context which enabled the human entrance to Europe along the eastern Adriatic shelf since this pathway is still widely unknown and the detailed framework of climatic and environmental conditions still requires extensive research. In combination with landscape reconstruction based on high resolution geophysical methods will allow the insight to the preserved changes in the landscapes at selected sites along the Eastern Adriatic and their habitability related to the Mesolithic cultures that were present there. Submarine prehistoric sites in the Mediterranean show that the continental shelf was occupied by humans to a depth of at least -40m, and the lost (submarine) lakes and surrounding submerged landscapes of the eastern Adriatic have a potential for site discovery. 					 				|	|Geology|	|Paleolimnology, Paleoclimate, Last Glacial Maximum, Holocene, Pleistocene, Mesolithic, Sea Level Rise, Proxies, Human Migration, Adriatic Shelf, Karst|

Dijana Žilić, |	|Systems exhibiting geometrical frustration challenge contemporary condensed-matter physics due to the fact that they exhibit strange dynamical properties such as boson peak excitations, which strongly deviate from the standard Debye model. Therefore, the quest for a self-consistent theory applicable for description of systems with lattice disorder is a fundamental issue. Despite the efforts put into investigation of vibrational excitations in disordered systems at low temperatures, the consensus about their physical origin is still lacking. This project aims to address the subject by fully exploiting the advantage of embedded paramagnetic centres through focusing on their relaxation behaviour, which bears the information about the local frustration of the environment. The energy exchange within the spin system and between the spin system and the lattice will be detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) as a function of disorder in the vicinity of the paramagnetic centre. This we can control by preparing the host matrix in the glassy, supercooled or crystalline state. We propose to investigate the specific molecular dynamics due to the presence of disorder in the system while switching the very same compound doped with paramagnetic centres from disordered to more ordered state, such as from glassy to crystalline state. Additionally, the microscopic picture of local disordered sites will be examined in other systems doped with paramagnetic centres such as various polymer matrices or hydrogen-bonded crystals. The origin of local disorder will be correlated with the influence of different numbers of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of paramagnetic site as well as with the degree of local spin frustration. We expect that this comparative study will enlighten the peculiarities of vibrational density of states of amorphous materials and contribute towards development of the unique model of low-temperature molecular dynamics of disordered systems in general. 					 				|	|Physics|	|ESR, disorder, boson peak, spin relaxation, spin frustration|

In our work we will concentrate on descriptive induction whose goal is to construct knowledge that enables human understanding of the data. Included are techniques for construction of user-interpretable models, segmentation of the corpus of examples, and detection of outliers. The methodology is relevant for the computer science fields known as intelligent data analysis, knowledge discovery from data, and data mining. At Rudjer Boskovic Institute we are developing machine learning algorithms for more than 15 years and we have successfully applied them in various domains including chemistry, biology, medicine, social sciences, economics, and manufacturing. With this project we want to extend the existing methodology and to implement novel techniques able to cope with data contained in complex structures. The main topic will be spatio-temporal structures but we will work also with networks of data, relational databases, and data contained in ontologies. Previous experience clearly demonstrates that complete transformation of information contained in structured data into a form that may enter the induction process is not a simple task. Our goal is to develop and implement systematic and general approaches for this conversion. The consequence will be explosion of generated data that must enter into the process of induction. Therefore, the second goal will be implementation of efficient algorithms for descriptive induction. The work includes development of novel algorithms for clustering and outlier detection in sets of unclassified examples and implementation of hardware for fast execution of rule learning algorithms. The third goal is application and evaluation of implemented algorithms in various real-life domains. The success of the complete project will be measured by the quality and usefulness of knowledge obtained in these applications. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|machine learning, knowledge discovery, structured data, rule learning, FPGA|

The focus of this research project highlights a specific historical situation: the endeavours of Yugoslav authorities in making of a new socialist citizen after the World War II, especially in Croatia as one of the republics forming the Yugoslav Federation. The socialist citizen was first placed in a strongly Soviet-oriented society, but the situation very soon shifted towards a specific kind of Yugoslav self-management and market socialism. The long period of four and a half decades (1945-1990) calls for special attention due to changes in the political system over time: from the formative period of the socialist man to the partial deconstruction of the concept. In many ways Croatia represents an excellent case-study for the research of the Yugoslav society, but in this project it will always be included in the Yugoslav framework and – whenever necessary – in a wider historical context and related comparatively to other socialist societies ruled by communist parties. The academic profile of researchers included in the project guarantees that the new socialist citizen will be closely analyzed in a variety of his or her appearances: from childhood to retirement, in work and leisure or sport, as a creator and a recipient of culture, from the theoretical ideals of high politics to the successful or problematic practices. A wide selection of written, visual and oral sources will be interpreted with a complex multi-disciplinary methodology that includes political, economic, social and cultural history, social and cultural anthropology, cultural studies and linguistics. The aim is to set a new light to the period and topic that are still under-researched by the Croatian and other post-Yugoslav humanities. 					 				|	|History|	|socialist society, self-management, ideology in practice, communist indoctrination, Croatia, Yugoslavia|

Few hypotheses are formulated: (1) sports experiences that tourists seek differ significantly from one another and can be sorted in several characteristic groups; (2) the main elements of the existing business models of sports tourism in less developed tourist destinations are identical to the main elements of the existing business models of best practice, but their application in practice differ; (3) by analysing the collected primary qualitative data on the characteristics of the existing business models of sports tourism, it is possible to reach knowledge relevant to the design of effective business models capable to provide different types of sports experiences. Gorski kotar (GK) as one of the least developed tourist destinations in Croatia may be appropriate location to explore these issues. We will identify and assess the supply-side (sports events and activities) and conduct a survey on sports tourists in GK in order to generate several types of sports experiences and to determine potential relationship between the types of sports experiences and expenditure of tourists. For benchmarking purposes the same procedure will be applied on selected best practices outside the area of GK. Finally, we will conduct interaction research on existing business models in GK and external best practices. In this way we will get better insight into the business models that deliver different experiences and we will be able to propose the conceptual business models for all types of sports experience. New findings on business models could be of significant benefit for sports tourism providers in GK and other similar destinations. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Business model, management, sports experiences, sports tourism, tourist destination|

By 2020 there will be 8 billion people and 50 billion machines in the world and almost all of them will be connected through some kind of network. Furthermore, people and machines that share a certain collective goal will be grouped into some kind of organization, which again will be connected with other organizations and/or people/machines. In order to maintain sustainability of the networked society we need a framework and algorithms which will enable us to i) manage trust; and ii) coordinate interactions in such a complex eco-system consisting of thousands, millions or even billions of interconnected entities. Both the framework and algorithms should be scalable and robust (from the perspective of a network size and heterogeneity), support real-time dynamics (from the perspective of network interactions) as well as be applicable and analyzable at different levels of granularity (at a micro, mezzo and macro network levels). A possible solution for the framework is the “Smart Network”, where people/machines/organizations are represented as nodes which are described by profiles and build a network of connections. The “smartness” of “Smart Networks” stems from profiling nodes and realizing connections using automated computational methods, what is enabled by latest enhancements in information systems and state-of-the-art solutions in communication technologies. The “Smart Network” framework enables design of scalable, robust and real-time algorithms for managing trust and coordinating interactions because it can be i) formally operationalized as a graph where edges represent nodes and vertices represent connections; ii) functionally modeled as a multi-agent system where agents embody edges and relationships embody vertices; and iii) analyzed through complexity theory where sustainable solutions emerge as a result of a bottom-up modeling principle. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|social networks, machine-to-machine communication, networked organizations, networked society, trust, coordination, context-awareness, big data|

This project will study the structure of microbial community and microbial food web, as well as its quantitative, qualitative (structural) and functional responses to natural and man-induced changes in marine environment and will try to detect potential indicators of these changes. The main focus of the project will be to study what changes in the structure and functioning of marine microbial food web in terms of global warming we can expect, and how these influences are manifested with regard to the trophic status of the area. The role of phosphorus will be particularly studied with regard to the fact that Adriatic Sea is generally phosphorus limited area. Research will consist of monthly field sampling that will include estuary, coastal and open sea areas, as well as laboratory and in situ experiments. Project activities will be carried out through three main topics: (1) Structure of microbial food web on spatial (different marine environments), trophic (trophic gradient) and temporal (intra- and inter-annual) scales, and possibly temperature and salinity scales (cross comparisons between natural systems under different temperature and salinity regimes); (2) Bacterial carbon flux which include grazing experiments and study of bacterial carbon flux through the microbial food web; and (3) Experimental impact of temperature increase and phosphate additions on microbial community structure and carbon flux toward the higher trophic levels. 					 				|	|Biology|	|microbial community, microbial food web, grazing, carbon flux, global warming, phosphorus, bacterial respiration, bacterial growth efficiency|

This project proposal is targeting changes in the marine plankton due to fast response to environment changes. The research activities are organized in two highly interconnected research modules: (Module 1) Anthropogenic influence on the marine environment and (Module 2) Investigations of climate changes on ecological processes and plankton communities. Module 1 related activities are to be studied by combining data on spatial distribution, intensity and consequences of human impacts with available time-series data on abundances and population structure of plankton communities in coastal waters, and by taxonomic research in transitional waters (Task 1.1.), by determining deposition and bioaccumulation of health-threatening organic compounds and heavy metal contaminants in the marine ecosystem (Task 1.2.) and by quantifying dispersion of particles through the use of Lagrangian models (Task 1.3.). Climate change impacts on marine plankton will be investigated by identifying climate-population connections using long-term oceanographic and plankton data series through the innovative synthesis techniques (Task 2.1) and by tracing the climate related changes through identification and chronology of biological time capsules such as dinoflagellate cysts (Task 2.2., Pilot project Lingulodinium polyedrum). The proposed project represents a novel approach to the study of climatologically and environmentally driven changes to the marine plankton populations. The results are expected to make contribution towards the long-term program of ecological monitoring that is needed to track the sea health, address the current climate issues, and maximize the potential to recommend permanent solutions. 					 				|	|Biology|	|marine plankton, anthropogenic influence, climate change, ecological modelling, dinoflagellate cysts, Adriatic Sea|

Thin and composite structures are of extreme importance for applications in engineering (e.g. building blocks, boats, ships, aircraft design) and biology (bones, biological tissues, blood vessels) where they are often subjected to fluid load. The analysis of these kind of complex multi-physics systems is very challenging from the mathematical point of view. Namely, the analysis of thin and composite structures and fluids includes the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations (nonlinear PDEs), which leads to interesting mathematical questions (Gamma limits of a certain system of nonlinear equations with highly oscillating coefficients, existence for a certain system of nonlinear PDEs). This project plans the following: derivation of lower dimensional models in elasticity for highly oscillating materials, optimal design problems, derivation and analysis of fluid-structure interaction problems (derivation of coupling conditions, well-posedness and asymptotic stability analysis). We will use both Calculus of Variation and PDEs techniques to approach different topics, using the benefits from both. We strongly believe that this diversity will bring additional value to Croatian applied mathematics and will provide young people to develop and get acquainted with different approaches of the modern applied mathematics. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|thin structures, composite structures, dimensional reduction, homogenization, Gamma convergence, fluid-structure interaction, existence of solution|

In many such situations the original physical laws can be replaced by empirical laws or other approximations derived on engineering level of rigor. Mathematical point of view requires justification of those models to see their validity, applicability and accuracy. That can be achieved theoretically by investigating the deviation from the original model, or numerically by comparing simulations with experimental data. Each approach, has its advantages and disadvantages and are, frequently, complementary. In the frame of MaSiMo project we will consider fluid flow through thin domains like pipes and fractures, as well as low permeability domains as porous media.The fluids are either Newtonian or micropolar, monophase or multiphase. Physical processes in those fluids are convective, diffusive, dispersive or conductive, isothermal or nonisothermal. Theoretical analysis is based on a priori estimates for governing differential equations, different notions of convergence and compactness. In particular asymptotic analysis and homogenization will be used. For derivation of a priori estimates a powerful tool is the entropy dissipation method that is considered in this project in the context of nonlinear diffusion and population dynamics problems with a perspective of extension to other considered models. Proposed research is connected to many engineering disciplines, such as mechanical and petroleum engineering, hydrogeology etc. Expected results could improve engineering practice. In Croatian mathematical community there is a significant research in this field with several trained scientists. However, they are dispersed in smaller groups. One of the aims of this project is formation of larger research group with focused scientific interests more competitive in a search for European grants. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Mathematical modelling,Asymptotic analysis,Numerical simulations,Fluid flow,Homogenization, Boundary layer,Lubrication,Complex fluids,Porous medium|

Although there are many algorithms that solve these problems and the theory is well developed, many unanswered questions still remain and so major improvements are possible. The aim of this project is to study and improve the existing and to develop new Jacobi-type algorithms for standard and generalized eigenvalue and singular value problems and real Schur decomposition. As ancillary algorithms a highly accurate algorithms for the standard and hyperbolic singular value decompositions and cosine-sine factorizations of orthogonal and J-orthogonal matrices will be developed. The last two belong to the class of orthosymmetric matrices and we intend to study structured matrices in this class and work on the efficient algorithm development. Modern numerical algorithms must be efficient, robust, stable and adaptable for use on the latest computing resources (CPU and GPU parallel processing). Since many of the standard diagonalization algorithms are adorned with high relative accuracy and inherent parallelism, one of the goals of this project is the development of new sequential and parallel block algorithms. Theoretically, their global and maybe the quadratic asymptotic convergence will be proved and high relative accuracy estimated. The success of the project is guaranteed by the selection of the researchers in the team. The team is comprised of experts with a proven track record in the theory of matrices and matrix (especially Jacobi-type) algorithms, together with experts in scientific computing and also several doctoral students who have already shown a strong interest in matrix theory and applications. As output of the project, it is expected that more than 10 papers will be published in leading scientific journals and several (5-6) in journals on the SCIE list, the complementary software will be developed and the algorithms implemented. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|Matrices, matrix factorizations, block algorithms, software, efficiency, accuracy, convergence|

Thereby, we will investigate models of new physics in which such new particles are introduced in attempts to explain neutrino masses and abundance of dark matter in the universe. To achieve these objectives we will study specific hadronic processes, both in the high-energy regime where strong force is weak enough for perturbative approach, as well as in regimes where non-perturbative features of QCD, such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking come to the fore. Our focus will be on processes measured by the range of experimental collaborations which will facilitate close contact with reality and immediate testing of our results and ideas. As outcome, we expect to be able to significantly improve the knowledge of the quark-gluon structure of the proton, as encoded by the so-called generalized parton distributions, to improve the description of various meson properties in vacuum and at finite densities and temperatures, to elucidate QCD phase diagram in model frameworks, and to set bounds to the parameter space of several models of new physics. 					 				|	|Physics|	|quantum chromodynamics, hadrons, quarks and gluons, quark matter, leptons, neutrino mass, new particles at LHC, dark matter|

The area flourished after the introduction of new techniques, liquid-assisted grinding and ion- and liquid assisted grinding, involving additives in the reaction mixtures. Despite a growing rate of published articles, the means of controlling the basic milling reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure in the vessel, is still not a part of standard milling procedures. Moreover, understanding of the effect of reaction conditions and additives on milling-reaction mechanisms is currently on speculative level. The main objective of this project proposal is to explore fundamental aspects of mechanochemical solid-state reactions under controlled pressure and in a range of temperatures. We will employ different gases (with special focus on environmentally relevant gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and sulfur- or nitric oxides) as reacting agents and templates for the synthesis of porous metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks, to selectively bind pollutant gases to nonporous coordination compounds or to functionalize carbon atoms in organometallic compounds. To successfully implement the objectives of this project proposal, we will develop milling vessels where the described reaction conditions can be achieved. Mechanistic aspects of gas-solid milling reactions will be studied by our novel in situ and real-time monitoring techniques. The experience and knowledge acquired by the project implementation will be applied to mechanochemical formation of target materials in order to broaden understanding and application scope of mechanochemical reactivity. The project results are expected to have a strong transformative effect on solid-state reactivity in a research laboratory as well as in chemical industry. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|mechanochemical synthesis, solid-state reactivity , in situ monitoring, gas-templation and adsorption, functionalization of metal-carbon bond|

Platelets are involved in hemostasis, thrombosis and inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases may be a sign of pathological platelet activation. Prrviously we have shown that biologically active substances, i.e. flavonoids can affect platelet aggregation at concentrations that can be achieved in the blood after consumption of foods rich in polyphenols. Flavonoids may affect the diagnostic tests-functional tests of platelet aggregation. Further studies are to focus on metabolism of flavonoids, possible interactions, and their QSAR prediction. Goals of our proposed project are to determine: 1. Metabolism of flavonoids–these compounds can easily be transformed: oxidations, (de)methylations; thus our objective is to determine which forms are the most prominent ones (parent compound or metabolites) using human liver microsomes, recombinant liver cytochromes P450 and LC-MS/MS. 2. Interactions of flavonoids–interactions of flavonoids with other commonly used drugs on cytochrome P450 enzymes (metabolic interactions) as well as binding of flavonoids to human serum albumin (distribution interaction) will be studied. 3. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR)–based on the results of metabolic and interaction studies, predictive QSAR models will be set giving insight into structural features of flavonoids responsible for interaction and susceptibleness to cytochrome P450 metabolism. In addition to scientific contributions, this research also has social and economic justification. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in the USA in 2010 was 37%, resulting in 444 billion USD of costs. In the EU this issue is addressed with special attention as an increase in costs of 40% for the treatment of these diseases is expected in the next 20 years. This drives scientific, as well as pharmaceutical community to search for a better and safer drugs, with flavonoids as prominent candidates. 					 				|	|Pharmaceutical sciences|	|biologically active substances, metabolism, interactions, cytochromes P450, human serum albumin, QSAR|

Psychology of education attempts to identify mental processes and mechanisms underlying our ability to learn. Research on self-regulated learning and metacognition is a topic of special importance for educational psychology. Self-regulated learning encompasses cognitive, motivational and behavioral processes which occur while learners undertake activities to accomplish a learning goal. Self-regulation is based on a cyclical process of monitoring and control. The learner monitors the efficiency of the applied learning strategies and responds to feedback obtained from the monitoring process. Metacognition is studied intensively in the areas of memory and text comprehension. The central aim of the project is to explore metacognitive processes of monitoring and control in the domains of: 1. Category learning, 2. Thinking, 3. Grounded (situated) comprehension. All of these domains have been studied extensively but in isolation from metacognition. Our goal is to bring together these disparate fields of study under the same research program. Unifying theme of the project is the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 processes which can be identified in each domain and whose properties will guide metacognitive judgments. Project team consists of 5 established researchers in the field of experimental psychology and 5 doctoral students whose PhD theses are closely related to the project aims. The project team will utilize newly established Laboratory for experimental psychology equipped with facilities necessary to carry out the proposed project. The project will answer the important question of how accurate are the metacognitive judgments and how effective are the processes of monitoring and regulation in the cognitive domains where metacognition has not been studied in greater detail. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|metacognition, monitoring, dual processes, category learning, thinking, comprehension|

Ions are very efficient in creating numerous ionizations on their path through the material by ejecting/exciting electrons (electron stopping) and in creating vacancies by recoiling the whole atoms (nuclei) from their lattice sites (nuclear stopping). Therefore, irradiation of materials with energetic ion beams is considered as a) an efficient tool to alter materials physical, chemical, electrical and optical properties and b) a sensitive probe that can be used to characterise materials using some of the Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) methods. Understanding of complicated dynamical processes that lead to structural modifications of materials requires the knowledge of experimental data related to kinematics of defects during and after irradiation. Therefore the goal of the present proposal is experimental study of the time evolution of radiation induced changes induced by energetic (MeV) ion beams and their characterization using the RBI Tandem Accelerator Facility. The focus will be on studying: (i) influence of electronic stopping and related nanostructuring of materials by ion track methodology; (ii) influence of nuclear stopping to radiation damage and amorphization in crystals, including crystalline and functional materials of interest for future fusion reactors; (iii) charge transport properties in crystalline materials, focusing on novel semiconductor materials for radiation detection. Experimental methodology relies mostly on the unique RBI dual-beam end station that will be used for ion beam irradiations and simultaneous characterization of induced changes using IBA methods like RBS and PIXE in channelling mode, ERDA, NRA and PIGE, as well as IBIC (Ion Beam Induced Charge). 					 				|	|Physics|	|MeV Ion Beams, Stopping Power, Ion Beam Modification of Materials, Ion Beam Analysis, Ion Beam Channeling, IBIC, RBS, PIXE, PIGE|

Despite common principles in connectivity, human cerebral cortex contains specific neuron types like associative layer III pyramidal neurons and subtypes of calretinin expressing GABA-interneurons. They are key elements of human microcircuitry which molecular specificity and neuronal interaction between and inside columns needs to be determined in order to assess how human cerebral cortex processes information. The aim of this project is to study organization and molecular properties of microcircuitry in the human frontal cortex that is believed to have unique features being the biological substrate for the most complex cognitive functions. The emphasis is to use histo-molecular techniques to dissect connectivity at cellular level and to establish a experimental monkey model to study microcircuitry in collaboration with Brain Dynamic Institute Marseille (http://ins.medecine.univmed.fr/) and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig (http://www.eva.mpg.de/). This will enable formation of unique database providing structural, physiological, molecular and genetic fingerprint of identified neurons as well as their connectivity within the entire cortical network in primates. Such database will be extremely valuable to create a simulation model of the human brain and to understand neuronal network alterations in various brain disorders. Studying cortical circuitry in the human is in the focus of current neuroscience research. Proposed project has potential to overcome gap in knowledge at cellular level, providing information gainful for more comprehensive interpretation of data obtained by imaging studies.

This project aims to explore demographic, socio-economic and political circumstances in Croatian borderlands, and to examine cause and effect relationships between these circumstances (developmental components) that made up the everyday life of Croatian soldiers, their families and households, and formed their identity. Research will focus on the Otočac and Lika Regiments of the Military Frontier, Zadar and Kotor as central strongholds of the Republic of Venice on the East Adriatic, the Republic of Dubrovnik and Dalmatia during the French and Austrian administration. The reconstruction of everyday life and the identity of the martial people that inhabited these borderlands will include: 1. demographic data (birth rates, fertility and mortality), migrations and the socio-economic context (age, gender and professional structure); 2. the military and war context (military organization and training, la petite guerre - partisan warfare - and the art of war, images and self-awareness of Croatian soldiers); 3. the geo-political context (administrative and legal organization, government transitions). One of the main objectives of the research team is to process a large quantity of muster rolls and other military lists, birth, marriage and death registers, casualty lists, land registers etc, covering the Otočac and Lika Regiments, Zadar, Dalmatia, Republic of Dubrovnik and Kotor in order to create an open access database that can be integrated within networks as EHPS-Net and MOSAIC and will thus serve a multidisciplinary purpose. 					 				|	|History|	|cultural history, historical demography, Habsburg Monarchy, Venice, Military Frontier, Dalmatia, guerilla, muster rolls, military revolution, news|

A beta-turn structure is proposed as key feature of chiral catalysts that resemble artificial enzymes with a minimal but functional outer-coordination sphere. These minimal artificial enzymes could find applications in asymmetric synthesis of drugs or drug intermediates produced by pharmaceutical industry. In asymmetric catalysis it is well established that the chiral information should be incorporated as close as possible to the coordination sphere of the catalytic metal. We challenge this important principle and use a catalytic metal center that is only prochiral. The chirality is transmitted by ''backdoor induction'' via hydrogen bonding of distant pendant amino acids that represent the outer-coordination sphere. Preliminary results provide a proof of concept and strongly indicate that simple amino acid bioconjugates of monodentate triphenylphosphane ligands can form supramolecular L2M complexes with Rh(I) that selectively catalyze a model asymmetric hydrogenation reaction with major impact of the distant amino acid sequence on selectivity [Kirin and Kokan, RSC Adv. 2012, Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2013 and Organometallics 2014; ee’s up to 84 %]. Within this project, a significant extension is proposed including (i) the use of new ligand bioconjugates with phosphorous or nitrogen donor atoms, (ii) the use of new substrates and (iii) the use of other transition metals for different asymmetric reactions, namely Ru(II)-catalyzed hydrogenation, Pd(II)-catalyzed alkylation and Ln(III) catalyzed silylcyanation. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Amino Acids, Asymmetric Catalysis, Bioinorganic Chemistry, Coordination Chemistry, Supramolecular Chemistry|

The European Water Framework Directive lays the EU water pollution strategy, and includes a list of priority substances which represent a significant risk to aquatic environment. The conventional water treatment technologies rely mostly on physical and biological processes which seem to be inadequate for effective removal of priority substances. Therefore, development of sustainable water treatment technologies requires the application of advanced chemical processes. Although the conversion of pollutants is main criterion in evaluation of treatment efficiency, the environmental aspects of applied technology are related to the overall quality of treated water which can be expressed in the terms of ecological sum-parameters. The main goal of MEAoWT project is to propose sustainable technology for the treatment of water containing priority pollutants (pharmaceuticals and pesticides) and to provide the methodology for the prediction of environmental aspects of applied technology, as a powerful tool for water quality assessment and pollution control. For that purpose UV/H2O2, UV/S2O82- and ferrate(VI) oxidation processes will be applied for the degradation of selected priority pollutants in water. Experimental data will be used for development of models combining statistical, mathematical, mechanistic and structural approaches using advanced computational tools. Structural characteristics of water pollutants, degradation mechanisms and kinetics as well as operating parameters of treatment processes will be correlated with the quality of treated water in terms of ecological sum-parameters. The methodology for prediction, assessment and control of the environmental aspects of water treatment technology will be proposed. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|priority pollutants, advanced water treatment, environmental aspects, mechanistic modeling, molecular modeling|

A practical objective of the proposed research project is to build an optimal economic growth/cycle model for Croatia using Advanced Growth Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm (AGSIFAL) that we plan to build. In order to do so, an algorithm (selected from the best of artificial neural network model, structural econometric model, dynamic general equilibrium model, nonlinear econometric model, golden triangle model) for cycle/growth sequencing and forecasting will be developed. Sequencing of the economic growth on a international scale (119 countries) will be performed using business cycle tracer methods and novel golden triangle model developed by Škare (2010). For this purpose, advanced cycle/growth algorithm will be created. Using individual country data as primer, we plan to isolate growth determinants using three dimensional golden triangle model and spectral analysis techniques. Output, inflation and employment form the three dimension of the cycle/growth triangle that will be used for sequencing growth. After a growth sequencing is finished, a best forecasting algorithm is built from the derived growth sequencing bases. Pairing isolated growth determinants help us to rebuild a growth sequence. Using different algorithm models, reconstructed economic growth series is compared to the actual growth series (observed data). Algorithm resulting in the smallest forecast error (RMSE) is selected as optimal to explain economic growth and predict business cycles. EThis conclusion will have important theoretical and policy implications both for the science of economics and economic agents on the market. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Growth, forecasting, algorithm, dynamic models, golden triangle model|

Project initial hypothesis is that artist networks, art groups and art associations form the most important platform of cultural exchange in modern and contemporary visual arts due to the similarity of underlying organization and communication models regardless of geo-cultural location at which they appear. A degree of their diversity in art practice of particular local community at particular historical moment is proportional to the dynamics and volume of its participation in the international/cross-cultural exchange. To prove our hypothesis and identify, describe and explain these organization and communication models as generally applicable – which is the main objective of the project - we shall investigate Croatian artist networking and collaborative practices on the background of similar phenomena in other European countries and with regard to poetic requirements of different periods in modern and contemporary art, conventions of social interactions and available techniques/technologies of communication. As the methodology of art history does not meet the complexity of the research topic, we shall develop interdisciplinary methodological apparatus combining knowledge and analytic tools of art history, sociology and information science. Considerable amount of data collected through the extensive infield research will be stored in Croatian Artists Networks Information System developed in the course of the project and supporting network visualization techniques as a cognitive research tool for experimental presentation of our research results framed with the appropriate structural narratives (textual, visual, GIS data).

The NEB could not be avoided by any known treatments but it is possible to decrease its duration and severity. Reproductive disorders in cows could be ascribed to significant decrease of body condition during puerperium and to systemic changes of metabolic, endocrine and oxidative parameters due to insufficient feed intake. Consequently, energy imbalance occurs due to increased milk production following parturition, peripartal stress and/or puerperal diseases. Such diseases have significant negative economic impact, during puerperium and afterwards by appearance of sterility. One of the most important puerperal diseases is mastitis which causes large economic losses particularly due to difficulties in diagnosis of its subclinical form. It is assumed that zeolite clinoptilolite (CPL) might modulate metabolic, endocrine and antioxidative status in dairy cows and thus improve their health, fertility and milk production. The objectives of the project are to evaluate effects of nutritive modulation by dietary CPL on: NEB, fertility, productivity and incidence of subclinical mastitis for early recognition of oxidative stress and systemic/local inflammatory responses involved in reproductive and productive disorders in dairy cows. The expected outcomes of the project will include well defined positive effects of nutritive modulation by dietary CPL on: (1) NEB, fertility and productivity regarding body condition and parity during transition period and late puerperium; (2) incidence/severity of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows.

During this process, a delicate energy balance is maintained between pumping of protons outside the inner mitochondrial membrane by the electron-transport chain proteins and transferring them back inside in the process of ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase. This balance is not always optimal and a special class of membrane proteins located inside inner mitochondrial membranes, called uncoupling proteins, serves as a control of the proton transfer rate through the membrane. Particular attention will be paid to the study of the reactivity of various reactive aldehydes generated during oxidative stress within phospholipid bilayers, towards uncoupling proteins. These deleterious reactions enhance the activity of uncoupling proteins resulting in the increased proton leak through inner mitochondrial membrane which in turn modifies energy balance inside the cell leading to various harmful diseases, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes and obesity. The project application uses the ''state of the art'' computational approach by combining quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Also, the theoretical work is expanded with the experimental work where model compounds will be synthesized and used in model reaction systems to further understand and cross-check the simulation results. The research will endorse health by providing the community better understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms by which deleterious aldehydes react with uncoupling proteins. The novel ideas will be proposed in order to better understand the function of uncoupling proteins, to develop drugs for improving health and to minimize effects due to oxidation processes. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|oxidative stress, reactive aldehydes, membrane proteins, organic synthesis, molecular dynamics, quantum chemical calculations|

Of all wildlife diseases parasitic diseases participate with 75%. In this project, selection of diseases encompasses potentially fatal diseases with high economic impact, frequently present disease with mainly subclinical course, and potential zoonotic diseases. Main objectives of the project are to: 1) determine the occurrence of selected parasitic diseases of gastrointestinal and respiratory system in red deer, roe deer, wild boar and jackal, 2) determine environmental factors that contribute disease occurrence, 3) determine the epidemiology of selected parasitic disease of wildlife, 4) analyse MHC genes expression in animals with different health status, and 5) analyse obtained results with molecular epidemiology tools. This will be achieved by interdisciplinary research team (composed of veterinarians, biologists and forester) divided in four main topics: parasitology, environmental conditions and GIS modelling, MHC genes polymorphism in wildlife and epidemiology and molecular epidemiology. Other objectives of the project are to facilitate establishment of internationally competent multidisciplinary research team through research, cooperation and continuing professional development and to enhance development of molecular epidemiology in Croatia. With such comprehensive approach proposed project offers for the first time in Croatia creation of multidisciplinary team that will analyse all aspects of wildlife diseases and important environmental factors. Furthermore, molecular epidemiology will provide insights into susceptibility to disease and potential survival rate that is dependent on major histocompatibility complex variations. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|molecular epidemiology, wildlife, parasitology, MHC genes, GIS modelling|

There is a pronounced variability among yeast cell wall proteins not only in their structures and activities, but also in the way they are incorporated into the wall. Some of them are attached non-covalently, some are linked covalently through an alkali labile ester linkage, and some are attached through GPI anchors and beta-1,6-glucan. The most abundant non-covalently attached protein Scw4p was found to be partly also covalently attached to glucan by a so far unknown linkage. One of the goals of this project is to explain the molecular nature of this linkage. Several cell wall proteins including Scw4p were found to be proteolytically processed. The second goal of the proposed project is to investigate which protease cleaves Scw4p and what is the physiological significance of this modification. Our comprehension of molecular mechanisms for incorporation of proteins in the yeast cell wall can be used for surface display of heterologous proteins expressed in yeasts. New plasmids will be created for this purpose for expression and wall incorporation of proteins in S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris. Besides, cell walls of several other non-Saccharomyces yeasts isolated from different habitats will be analysed to search for other potential hosts for surface display of proteins. Both existing, and newly investigated genetic systems will be used for surface display of six enzymes of the S-triazine complete degradation pathway from Pseudomonas ADP. Application of obtained strains in degradation of this world-wide commonly used herbicide will be explored. Described methodology would be used for surface display of several xylose reductases from several yeasts and the application of the obtained strains for enzymatic production of xylitol, combined with electrochemical regeneration of the necessary NAD(P)H. Potential of this method for application in biosensing will also be explored. 					 				|	|Biotechnology|	|yeast cell wall, cell wall proteins, protein localization, heterologous expression, surface display, genetic immobilization|

Integrins are cell surface molecules that mediate sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion, and therefore represent a suitable target for therapy. This proposal investigates the molecular mechanism behind knockdown of integrins alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 using integrin subunit specific siRNAs (beta 3, beta 5, beta 6, alpha v, alpha 3, alpha 4 or alpha 5) and the ability of such a treatment to sensitise TNBC and melanoma cell lines to anticancer drugs paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. Our next goal is to identify how specific integrin knockdown influences cell migration and invasion. The focal adhesions (FA) are sites of attachment between cells and extracellular matrix which may mediate differential cell responses by variation of FA protein composition. Therefore, the FA protein composition will be investigated before and upon integrin silencing using proteomics methodology. We will monitor formation and temporal evolution of FA in living cells during spreading or migration using reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM). On the basis of these data, several signalling pathways will be proposed and their involvement in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion will be experimentally verified. Our data will contribute to the knowledge on integrin signalling pathways, structure and function of focal adhesions. The understanding of integrin pathways involved in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, migration and invasion processes may provide novel insights into biology of these cancer cells and identify new target molecules in TNBC or melanoma. 					 				|	|Biology|	|breast cancer, melanoma, signalling pathways, anticancer drug resistance, focal adhesion, migration, invasion|

The evidence has been accumulated indicating the role of PVR and its receptors in immune surveillance including the control of viral infections, tumors, as well as in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Of note is that PVR is constitutively expressed on the majority of somatic cells, while its receptors are expressed on the majority of lymphocyte population. In many respects the interaction of PVR with its paired set of inhibitory and activating receptors resemble the interaction of paired co-stimulatory immune cell receptors and their cellular ligands (B7/CD28/CTLA-4). These co-stimulatory molecules have been the subject of intensive studies that resulted in immunoregulatory pharmaceutical agents for use in humans. The studies proposed here are based on the finding that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) affects the surface expression of PVR (Nat Immunol. 2005) and on our preliminary results indicating that mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) also downregulates mouse PVR. Thus, we first focused on the identification of MCMV gene(s) (proteins) involved in the PVR regulation, but also on the consequence of this viral regulation on antiviral immune response in vivo. To that aim we will generate MCMV mutants lacking viral regulators and test their in vivo susceptibility to components of innate and acquired immune response. We expect that the results obtained will further broaden the knowledge of PVR regulation and its significance in immune control, which will eventually help to translate this knowledge to developing new immunotherapeutic tools. Namely, one aim of this project is to engineer antibody specific for human PVR in order to be used as a tool in targeted tumor therapy. This idea is based on the fact that many tumors over-express PVR, which could be used in antibody mediated uptake of anti-tumor compounds. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|poliovirus receptor, PVR, CD155, cytomegalovirus, CMV, immunoevasion, tumor|

The most common form is rheumatoid arthritis (RA) characterized by bone and cartilage damage leading to deformity and permanent disability. Arthritis is also a common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mostly as a non-erosive form. In RA, inflammatory and immune cells create a microenvironment that favors osteoresorption by increasing osteoclast, and suppressing osteoblast differentiation and activity. Current treatment options such as biological therapeutics may modify the course of disease, but are not able to reverse osteoresorption. The Fas/Fas ligand system is important regulator of immune system homeostasis, and there is accumulating evidence for the role of this system in the regulation of bone homeostasis. Inactivation of Fas has a bone-sparing effect, preventing bone loss upon estrogen withdrawal, as well as in inflammatory arthritides, but the exact lineages and signaling pathways mediating this effect are not defined. Using the murine model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in mice deficient for Fas, and synovial fluid samples from patients with RA and SLE, we aim to identify cell populations responsible for inhibition of osteoresorption, as well as functional alterations in these populations by analysing their gene expression profiles. In addition, we expect to confirm the role of identified genes/molecules by their inactivation in vivo in the murine model of AIA, and the role of a lineage using conditional lineage-specific models of Fas-inactivation. The analysis of human samples will allow for the translation to the clinical setting. Our approach aims to identify novel cellular/molecular drivers of bone resorption in arthritis, on a lineage-specific level. Proposed studies will provide new targets for preventing, reducing, and potentially reversing the osteoresorptive process which is a consequence of inflammatory events. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|arthritis, Fas, osteoresorption, lineage, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation|

The primary aim is to determine the long-term virological, immunological and clinical outcome as well as trends in the molecular epidemiology of HIV infection. We will also specifically address issues such as: subclinical atherosclerosis in both HIV-infected patients taking ART and non-HIV-infected participants; the influence of food habits, specifically adherence to the Mediterranean diet on subclinical atherosclerosis; the frequency of HIV subtypes among newly-diagnosed patients entering clinical care in the period 2014-2017; transmission clusters of B and non-B subtypes; prevalence and patterns of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to different classes of antiretroviral drug resistance in newly-diagnosed HIV-infected persons in the period 2014-2017 with the impact of transmission clusters on the prevalence of TDR. The study population will include all patients in care at UHID who provided written consent. Patient eligible for analysis were or will be seen in care at UHID from 1997 to 2017. It is estimated that a total of about 700-800 will be included into the analyses.

Final objective of this project is the establishment of the Croatian National Centre for Motor Development at the Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb. The set of scientific objectives and project assignments per year will allow: a) the evaluation of motor skills of preschool children in the Republic of Croatia, b) the determination of differences in motor skills of preschool children who are involved in different degrees of physical activity and exercise programs, c) the definition of the connection of motor development with the other domains of children development (socio-emotional and language), d) the determination of impact of parental interests in sports and their physical activity levels on children's motor skills, and e) the assessment of different training programs effects on motor skills and abilities of preschool children. The study will embrace 1,500 boys and girls aged 3 to 7 years and their parents from different areas of the Republic of Croatia. Subjects’ testing will be conducted in two parts. First, the parents will fill out the questionnaire, and second, the children’s motor skills will be measured through two sets of motor development and motor proficiency tests. The resulting data would represent a foundation for the normative values and further research on motor status of children in the Republic of Croatia. Also, the findings will be the starting point for the development of strategies promoting motor development through various programs and research activities of the newly established Croatian National Center for Motor Development. 					 				|	|Kinesiology|	|fundamental movement, physical abilities, toddler, exercise, physical activity, kindergarten|

Consequently, opportunities for computer vision applications are becoming more and more abundant. Understanding dynamic traffic scenes is especially interesting due to exciting applications in the fields of smart vehicles (driver assistance, autonomous cars) and intelligent transportation systems (road safety inspection, adaptive traffic control). Nevertheless, many of these applications are out of reach since the computers are still unable to match human perception. We believe that this gap would be reduced by improving our understanding of scalable detection of multiple object classes in dynamic scenes. The task of object detection is to localize objects of interest in input images. We address detection in the most general case where the objects of interest exhibit large appearance variation. In this case the problem is often referred to as multi-class object detection. Our proposal focuses on dynamic traffic scenes acquired by a calibrated stereo rig from the driver's perspective. We propose to develop detection approaches which would combine estimated camera motion and scene structure with learned appearance features, and to experimentally compare them with the state of the art. We shall employ advanced methodologies such as SfM, dense stereo, variational optimization, scene flow, spatio-temporal descriptors, latent SVM and Fisher vectors. These methodologies shall enable us to achieve improvements upon the state of the art in terms of scalability and detection performance. This will open way to exciting applications capable of reducing traffic accidents, improving efficiency and decreasing traffic congestion. Some of these applications shall be demonstrated by experiments on a real autonomous car. The proposed research would also contribute to a future unified theory of computer vision which would encompass detection, reconstruction and categorization. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|Computer vision, structure from motion, object detection, image categorization, multi-body structure from motion|

The number of those identified as victims in Croatia remains low. However, there is no dispute that the dark number in this field is significant. This could be explained by the structural deficiencies of national anti-trafficking policies and disregard of research and multidisciplinary approach in addressing three key priority areas – that of prevention, protection of victims, and prosecution of perpetrators. The need for the research based policies is indispensible for Croatia as a new EU member state that has been under the risk of turning into a country of destination for victims from the Western Balkan countries as well as from the countries either affected from internal instabilities and conflicts (e.g. Syria) or from the African countries (e.g. Nigeria). Therefore, the aim of this project is to contribute, through establishment of fully operational informal network of experts from different disciplines, in promoting research based policies and to provide support for establishment of National Rapporteur on THB (this is an obligation under the Directive 2011/36/EU that still has not been fully implemented by Croatia). The second research focus is corruption and economic crime, major obstacles for further development of society stretched between systemic dysfunctions characteristic for transition period and the rule of law standards formally accepted through the process of European integration. Informal network of experts will address the issues of liability of legal persons for corruption and economic criminal offences, shortcomings in legislation and case law, legislation that regulate access to information etc. 					 				|	|Law|	|crime, transition,research cluster, trafficking in human beings, corruption, economic crime|

While many materials show the indirect signs of the magneto-electric coupling, the direct experimental evidences could still improve our knowledge about mechanisms of the coupling and coexistence of two orders. Therefore, the upgrade of the existing SQUID and VSM magnetometers enabling investigation of influence of the electric field onto the magnetization, and also build up of instrumentation for measurement of electric polarization in applied magnetic field, would open large possibilities for magneto-electric research of the multiferroics. Multiferroicity appears in different groups of materials and investigation would be focussed on especially promising. New metal-organic frameworks are very perspective, and we will be working on their synthesis and modifications, in order to understand and influence their magneto-electric behaviour. Further, non-centrosymmetric metallic oxides, as well as their nanoparticles, offer large possibilities for the synthesis and modification of multiferroic properties. Proposed multidisciplinary research would result with the novel compounds and installed equipment for complete magnetic and electric characterization needed in research of multiferroics, giving integral set of experimental results, supplemented with detailed theoretical calculations.

Several new rickettsial and ehrlichial diseases, as well as new Borrelia and Babesia genotypes have been confirmed, and consequently, improved diagnostics of emerging diseases in veterinary and human medicine. A number of cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease have increased. To better understand the importance of tick-borne diseases, a proposed project follows an interdisciplinary approach involving physicians, veterinarians and biologists, also known as One Health approach. Since the cultivation of pathogens is difficult and slow, and for number of pathogens this cultivation is impossible, multylocus sequence typing MLST approach will be used for their genetic characterization of Babesia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi s. l., B. miyamotoi, Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp, Ehrlichia spp. Bartonella spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis from animal reservoirs, ticks and humans. Another objective will be to map tick species, since they were investigated 40 years ago, and to confirm species with PCR and sequencing. Application of genetic typing of multiple genes allows a detailed differentiation of genotypes and their heterogeneity. In this way, the genetic variability of the isolates, their geographical distribution and population genetic structure, as well as transmission routes of various isolates within ticks and their natural reservoirs, will be defined. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|tick-borne pathogens, multilocus sequnce genotyping, pathogen distribution, animals, humans|

Especially difficult situation occurs when loading is stochastic (e.g. wind, earthquake, traffic) since there is no direct relation between loading (input) and displacements (output). System parameter identification will be based on inverse mathematical formulation so to present a reliable and theoretically sound procedure for identification of required parameters. One of the main goals of the system identification procedure is representative volume identification. It will be necessary to consider non-Gaussian stochastic processes with heavy tails characterizing dangerous rare events. Regarding material parameters this project advocates the hypothesis that the fracture energy of a material is approximately constant and that the material constitutive law should not incorporate “rate effect”. The idea of (approximately) constant fracture energy for all loading rates is new and important in models of concrete under the dynamic loading. Also, the inclusion of the viscous parameter in the existing 3D microplane model for concrete is of vital importance for fatigue analysis since it connects creep and shrinkage (internal material loading) with dynamic loading (external structural loading). In the end the developed concrete model will account for corrosion by coupling the mechanical properties of concrete and properties affecting the transport of humidity, oxygen and chloride (chemo-hygro-thermo-mechanical model). The calibration of the 3D model and its verification will be performed based on the simulation of the corresponding experimental tests from the laboratory and the available literature according to the procedure for system parameter identification described above. Two main characteristics of the project: highly applicative and at the same time capable of producing high impact scientific results. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|multi-scale, concrete, system identification, dynamic loading, computer model|

By exploring assemblies ranging from molecular to cellular sizes we are aiming at building a unified view of the principal mechanisms responsible for domain formation and destruction. This new approach hasn't been explored as such in similar research projects. In the project's first year, by molecular dynamic simulations, we will quantify micro-heterogeneity in liquids as a structural order that exists on the local scale and doesn't propagate on the global scale. As a continuation of the first-year results, we will study how the structure of the above mentioned liquids changes when dissolving molecules that promote or destroy domains defined by the local ordering. The used methods will be simulations and integral equation theory. In parallel with the molecular scale studies, the cellular membranes will be probed by means of experimental measurements and simulations. The aim will be to describe the mechanism of destruction of lipid bilayers induced by antimicrobial peptides. Principal investigator Larisa Zoranić has competencies to establish a new research group with an interdisciplinary subject and members of diverse fields because of her scientific background in physics, biology and biophysics. She has experience working in both international and Croatian groups, thus obtaining the required managing skills. The group's acquired knowledge and expertize will ensure a good quality start towards more demanding issues that stem from the project. The aims and methods of this research are competitive internationally in the area of molecular physics and biophysics.

In order to assess structural integrity as well as to predict structural lifetime, an analysis at microlevel is required. In recent years, a special attention has been directed to the investigation of relations between macroscopic properties of materials and their microstructure as well as to perform a link to atomistic scale. Since classical continuum mechanics cannot consider structural effects in the material at the micro- and nanolevel, multiscale techniques are developed that model material deformation responses at multiple levels using appropriate numerical procedures. Deformation responses of arteries will be considered by using multiscale computational strategy too. A special attention will be directed toward the mathematical modeling of arterial growth and remodeling, which could help physicians to track certain cardiovascular diseases and predict their development. For modeling of engineering materials, a new micro-macro numerical procedure based on the second-order computational homogenization approach employing nonlocal continuum theory will be proposed. Both finite element and meshless spatial discretization will be applied. The damage evaluation at the microlevel which may lead to macroscopic fracture will be modeled. Here the damage evaluation law based on the computational averaging procedure will be used and the modeling at atomistic scale will be performed in the very narrow domain of localization. In the atomistic modeling using molecular dynamics, a special attention will be directed to the coupling of atomistic domain with the discretized continuum domain. An approach inspired by the quasicontinuum and bridging domain will be proposed. All results of the research will be tested by the modeling deformation responses of realistic materials. 					 				|	|Basic engineering sciences|	|Engineering materials, bilogical tissues, multiscale modeling, finite element method, meshless method, damage modeling, molecular dynamics|

Two new self-assembly processes of Ge quantum dots in dielectric amorphous matrices and consequently novel material types have been discovered recently by our group. We have performed intensive investigation of their structural properties since then, and we had found that they appear in many different shapes, internal structures and ordering types. One material can store large amounts of Hydrogen. However, only properties of Ge and SiGe quantum dots have been investigated, while all other materials and their properties are completely unknown. These materials are theoretically very suitable for applications, especially in photo-electric conversion and energy storage, so the investigations of their properties related to the applications are also very important. We intend to form a group which will be excellent in production, characterization and application of these materials. Precisely, we intend to (i) further investigate the observed self-assembly processes and develop new material types with interesting or extraordinary structural properties; (ii) determine the basic optical and electrical properties of these materials and (iii) produce simple devices based on these materials for energy conversion and storage. We expect preparation of new, applicative materials with exceptional properties, observation of unusual effects caused by specific structure, and preparation of efficient thin-film coatings for conversion and storage of Sun energy. These results could be of great relevance for the production of super-efficient energy-converting window glasses, as the method that we use for the preparation (magnetron sputtering deposition), is a standard technique for production of window coatings and low-emissivity glasses. 					 				|	|Physics|	|Quantum dots, Self-assembly, Magnetron sputtering, Quantum dot crystal, Hydrogen storage, Energy conversion, Solar cell, Ion-beam irradiation|

Infections with A. baumannii are difficult to treat due to its ability to express multiple intrinsic and acquired mechanisms responsible for multidrug-resistance (MDR) to antibiotics, biofilm formation, and long-term persistence in hospitals. Outbreaks of A. baumannii infections are considered to be caused exclusively by contamination and transmission in hospital environment. MDR A. baumannii were detected in hospital wastewater, but such data are lacking in Croatia. The prevalence of clinically important Acinetobacter spp. in nature and their potential to migrate into and/or out of the hospital environments are undefined to date. The natural habitats of clinically important MDR A. baumannii remain to be defined. Larger screening and epidemiological studies should be performed to investigate the impact of human waste on the spread of MDR A. baumannii. The objective of the proposed project is to isolate viable MDR A. baumannii from the environmental samples of wastewater and soils. The environmental isolates will be genotyped and their phylogenetic relation to human isolates will be determined, as well as the profiles and genes responsible for their antibiotic resistance. The influence of ecological factors on the survival of environmental isolates of A. baumannii will be investigated. Interaction of environmental isolates of A. baumannii and zeolites as environmental friendly disinfectants will be studied. Methods and alternative disinfectants based on natural materials for the remediation of wastewater and soils containing A. baumannii will be developed.

For that reason the main objective is to preserve the quality of all available sources of drinking water. Among all the threats to water in nature, leachate landfills are most dangerous because of their complex chemical composition and continuous uncontrolled pollution of groundwater. Processes and methods of preventing the spread of pollution into groundwater and leachate treatment are a challenge for many researchers. This proposal should be a contribution to the landfill leachate treatment using natural zeolite as a reactive barrier. This material is available in nature, environmentally compatible, thermally and chemically stable, and possesses adsorption and ion exchange properties. Depending of the surface charge, zeolites can uptake organic and inorganic positive and negative species. The desired surface charge can be achieved by chemical modification using different methods at a controlled pH value. Modified zeolites should have significantly higher removal capacities and selectivity towards pollutants contained in the landfill leachate. These wastewaters are highly concentrated, have the most complex possible composition, contain low biodegradable organic matter (halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols), inorganic ions (Cl-, NH4+, SO42-,NO3-, NO2-,PO43-), and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Mn). Many of these components have shown excellent removal from modal solutions onto zeolite; therefore investigations will start with batch studies, continue in lab-scale fixed bed columns, and finally in scale-up and multi stage columns filled with different modified zeolites. The multi stage column performance should be carried out with real leachate collected from the regulated landfills in the Dalmatian region. The exhausted zeolite, saturated with organic and inorganic pollutants, can be thermally treated and disposed of in nature, or solidified into the cement matrix. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|natural zeolites, landfill leachate, column method, heavy metals, reactive barrier|

The relevance of the topic of neomythologism stems precisely from the crisis in fundamental scientific research and reliance on the phenomenon of irrationality which is happening in the contemporary world. Since there is a crisis in the field of major scientific concepts, man tries to look for answers in a new mythology, which is visible in all forms of cultural research (literary text, visual arts, film, discourse of advertising). This is why this project proposal offers launching of a new type of research into neomythologism. The focus of the proposed research is based on the corpus of Russian and other Slavic literatures, including Croatian, in theatre, visual arts, film culture and contemporary media in order to study and define the elements of neomythologizing, especially those of the myths of everyday life (the myth of youth, the myth of the end of the world, the myth of the family, the myth of a healthy diet). Collection of materials, preparation works, workshops and conferences about the myths of everyday life shall take into account all aspects of this challenging topic in order to research this phenomenon, as well as the concept of the mythical in different aspects of Slavic cultures which are historically interconnected with a common mythology. The aim of the project is, hence, to obtain new scientific knowledge about the phenomenon of neomythologism which, though observable, has not scientifically been considered. 					 				|	|Philology|	|neomythologism, contemporary science, Russian literature/culture, Croatian literature/culture, myth, everydayness, Slavic Studies, humanities|

Shaped by societies, the media also shape societies. This relationship engenders social change that is at the core of the current mediatisation process and theory debates (Schulz, 2004; Krotz, 2007; Hjarvard, 2008; Hepp, 2011). Networked communication technologies reshape the equilibrium of the media/society relationship and extend the mediatisation process to new directions. The process is not a straightforward technological impact, but a complex accommodation process. In this research we study how the public sphere (Habermas, 1991) has been reshaped through networked communication (Cardoso 2008). We focus on four aspects of mediatisation: extension, substitution, amalgamation and accommodation (Schulz, 2004) to study organizational changes in the process of media production; and media use and practices among internet users. The main objective is to understand processes of media production, consumption and their interrelations, with regard to public communication through new, online and networked media. Specific goals include contributions to development of the mediatisation theory; establishment of a classification of online media in Croatia; development of mixed methods research designs and providing impetus to related public policies. We employ a sequential, explorative research strategy (Creswell, 2009). In the first stage, we conduct multiple, qualitative case studies of the processes of organizational change in different online media. In the second, intermediary stage we construct survey questionnaires based on previous qualitative work. In the third stage, we use a survey on a national representative sample and provide further analytical conclusions derived from the research. The potential users of our research results include: scientific research communities, media industry, media organizations, policy decision-makers, regulatory institutions, and various NGOs. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|Networks, public communication, public sphere, mediatisation, new media, Croatia|

The investigations will be done by an interdisciplinary approach on model systems with oppositely charged species based on mixtures containing two biopolymers. Studies of model systems, where the number of variables is greatly reduced, help to explain the intermolecular interactions between oppositely charged biopolymers and bioactive agents, which constitute a highly useful guideline for preparation of novel microcapsule formulations. Various common and modern techniques/methods will be used in investigation. The project, while being fundamental in nature, is of direct practical importance because better understanding of interactions between oppositely charged biopolymers and bioactive agents at the molecular level will serve as a base for production of novel microcapsule formulations for plant protection/nutrition. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|biopolymers, simultaneous microencapsulation of biofactors, biologically active agents, chemically active substances, plant nutrition|

In fact, sulfur dioxide is one of the most efficient additives used in winemaking due to its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. However, as a result of potential pseudo-allergenic health problems in sensitive individuals use of sulfur dioxide has recently come under the review. Hence, in recent decades, alternatives to reducing/replacing sulfites in winemaking have been extensively studied. However, finding promising substitutes with similar antiseptic and antioxidant characteristics still remains major challenge. Recently, emerging technologies such as high power ultrasound (HPU), high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and non-thermal plasma (NTP) have entered the field of food science and technology offering, as novel tools, new opportunities for managing food microbiology. Their opportunities in wine microbiology have not been examined. The aim of this project is to study the potential usage of HPU, HHP and NTP in production of high quality red, white and dessert wine as sulfur dioxide reducing strategies, and furthermore to optimize their application. Impact on overall wine quality, particularly chemical and sensory characteristic will be studied. Possibilities of these new technologies in controlling microbiological stability of wine will be investigated.

Whether the TMs behave as micronutrients or are highly toxic to organisms, their mobility, reactivity as well as bioavailability, strongly depends on chemical speciation. Our focus will be directed towards characterisation of interactions of TM with other macro and micro constituents of natural waters, particularly with natural organic matter, by employing the most recent approaches utilizing electrochemical and hyphenated spectrometric techniques. Particular effort will be invested in the development and improvement of speciation methods, measurement protocols and sensing electrodes. Methodologies developed under controlled laboratory conditions will be verified using natural water samples and applied in on-site and in-situ field-studies. The research will lead to the establishment of sets of specific measures and criteria which will allow reliable estimation of the actual state, but also the prediction of future behaviour of TMs (speciation, mobility, bioavailability/toxicity) in case of local environmental accidents (e.g. contamination) or global threats (e.g. ”ocean acidification”). Aquatic environments characterized by a variety of chemical compositions will be studied. In such conditions, variations in physical-chemical forms of the studied TMs (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) are expected to occur. Study sites will be estuarine, oxic/anoxic, eutrophic and clean/contaminated areas, in which processes occurring at the phase boundaries, as well as in the sediment and water column will be explored. The specific subjects of the research are selected in a way to enable the outcome of the project be valuable not only to the broad scientific community working on TM speciation, but also to the authorities managing coastal zones. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|trace metals, speciation, coastal aquatic ecosystems, modeling, sediments, contaminants|

Therefore, there is a necessity for developing novel molecular approaches to treat this disease. Unlike other tumors, in melanoma p53 is relatively rarely mutated. However, overexpressed p53 fails to function as a tumor suppressor and tumor cells continue to proliferate and spread. This suggests that regulation of p53 activity depends on the interplay between p53 and its binding partners. Based on current state of knowledge, we hypothesize that p53 function in malignant melanoma might be altered through the interactions with p53 small molecular weight and p73 isoforms, nm23/NDPK and Gli families of proteins. Thus we will search for p53 protein binding partners in melanoma. The interactions identified by mass spectrometry will be further confirmed using microarray-based approaches and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. Furthermore, the expression profile of genes/proteins of interest in panel of melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue samples will be investigated. The potential impact of the identified p53 interacting partners on its transcriptional activity and the stimulation of apoptosis will be determined. The depletion of partners using siRNA technology would confirm the involvement of selected proteins on p53 activity. The subcellular localization of the proteins in complex will be revealed by advanced fluorescent microscopy methods on state-of-the-art instrumentation what would give us the insight on dynamics of their interactions. The proposed research could provide a possible explanation why p53 function in melanoma is abrogated. The aim of this project is to determine the complexity of p53 interactions and their role in the onset and progression of human melanoma and offer new, innovative solutions in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|melanoma, protein interactions, p53, p73, nm23, Gli|

Instead, we unexpectedly discovered circulating Bmp1 gene metalloproteinase isoforms: BMP1-3 (mTld) in healthy men and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), BMP1-4 in liver cirrhosis (LC), BMP1-5 in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and BMP1-7 in pancreatitis. We then showed that injections of BMP1-3 protein deteriorate, while BMP1-3 neutralizing polyclonal antibody improves the kidney function and prevents death in rats with CKD. In addition, inhibition of BMP1-3 alone and in combination with a BMP1-4 antibody improved the organ function in LC and AMI. We assume that BMP1-3 represents a core regulatory pathway molecule essential in fibrosis, and its targeting may be sufficient to limit fibrosis progression. In line with these findings, in this project we propose a new scientific concept in combating fibrosis using core and organ specific regulatory pathways, through pursuing the following objectives: 1/ to produce recombinant BMP1 isoform proteins and related neutralizing isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies; 2/ to determine specific BMP1 isoform substrates; 3/ to develop new sensitive plasma bioassays for measuring BMP1 isoforms in different animal experimental models; 4/ to explore the role of BMP1 isoforms in the pathology and function of animals with CKD and LC. The most efficacious monoclonal antibodies variable domain will be sequenced, and than humanized for potential development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic application. This novel approach aims to acquire the first candidate specific treatment for halting or reversing the progression of CKD and LC. We hypothesize that modulation and/or inhibition of BMP1 isoforms represents future of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the field of molecular and translational medicine of fibrosis. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|metalloproteinases, chronic kidney disease, liver fibrosis, isoforms, humanized antibodies|

The scientific approach is based on a combination of theoretical and experimental knowledge and experience of collaborators, and includes quantum-chemical calculations and molecular modelling in the molecular design, chemical synthesis and physico-chemical characterisation of molecules. The aim of project is to study fundamental physico-chemical properties of supramolecular systems built by non-covalent interactions (NC) - hydrogen bonding and metal-ligand coordination. The objectives are: a) Synthesis and structural characterization of functionalized bis-chromophoric molecular systems possessing guanidine, (thio)urea and carboxylate functionalities by employment of novel environmentally friendly synthetic methods; b) Detailed insight into the fundamental mechanisms how NC bonds mediate excited energy-transfer processes from one chromophore to another within assemblies; c) Analysis of influence of guanidine and (thio)urea functionalities and their anion complexation on the spectroscopic properties; d) Study of novel assemblies based on NC interactions and influence of different media; e) Development of model heterogeneous photo-responsive catalysis materials; f) Construction of complex multichromophoric supramolecular assemblies. Results of fundamental studies carried out within this project will enrich the understanding of physico-chemical factors in electron transfer processes in supramolecular systems constructed of chromophoric pairs employing the non-covalent bonding.

The present study plan aims the research towards the gene regulatory mechanisms that control hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) homeostasis and differentiation, which is tightly regulated by an interplay of a number of transcription factors and environmental signals mediated by a Notch signaling pathway. Our group designed an experimental approach for studying the interaction of Notch signaling pathway with transcription factor genes associated with hematopoiesis with focus on Ikaros gene family. Our laboratory has established a diagnostic technique for quick and sensitive detection of aberrant Notch and Ikaros forms by single cell multiplex qRT-PCR, which is a unique tool enabling us to dissect the contribution of different members of the Ikaros and Notch families on differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells in a context of regulation of expression of target genes as well as non-coding RNAs, since they maintain the spatial organization of chromosome structure and regulate cell commitment. Our results will improve diagnosis and risk stratification for leukaemia patients which will be an important aid in informed clinical decisions. Therefore the proposed project will substantially advance the field towards better therapeutic options and contribute significantly to the field of stem cell medicine. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|hematopoietic stem cells, leukemia, Notch, Ikaros, non-coding RNA,differentiation,|

Combination of metal centres with polydentate organic ligands provide colossal, structurally-diverse, platforms possessing a variety of magnetic, electrical, thermal, optical and other properties. In the proposed project, two analogue bridging ligands, oxalate and substituted 2,5-dihydroxyquinonate (DHQ), will be used in the preparation of the coordination polymers of different dimensionality and topology. Their interactions with transition metal cations involve a variety of magnetic phenomena, which can be tuned by highly sensitive selection of structural fragments. The oxalate-based complexes will be studied not only as potential magnetic materials ordering at a certain temperature, but also as the single-source precursors for the preparation of technologically important mixed-metal oxides through the thermal decomposition process. This method of preparing oxides, as compared to conventional solid-state reactions, has several advantages: shorter thermal treatment at lower temperature, without repeating grinding procedures, and the products are more homogeneous. The DHQ complexes will be studied due to their potential for charge transfer, which may lead to materials with reversible magnetic transition. Also, promising class of the ligands are stable semiquinone radicals derived from variously substituted DHQs. So far, their complexes with transition metals are little-known and have not been exploited for design of functional materials. The interdisciplinary nature of the project requires a variety of methods to characterise these advanced materials: single-crystal and powder X-ray diffractions including X-ray charge density studies, thermal analyses (TG/DTA), IR, UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopies, etc. The results obtained will be used to correlate their structure and properties. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|functional materials, crystal engineering, crystal structure, magnetic properties, coordination polymers, mixed metal oxides, oxalates, quinones|

The procedure that we propose has additional importance, because the majority of modern iterative methods can be represented as a special case of our procedure. Therefore, it can be considered as a generalization of most modern iterative methods. In brief, it is actually an iterative procedure in which at each iteration step, discrete Ritz method is applied. At every step, coordinate vectors which form a subspace are generated, within which local energy minimum is sought, thus decreasing the total energy of the system, which therefore converges to the required minimum. The number of coordinate vectors (subspace dimension) is not limited, but aims to be small - much smaller than the number of unknowns. How to generate a good subspace - coordinate vectors is the central problem the project needs to address. Basically, with the method proposed it is possible to combine the good properties of several iterative methods simultaneously. Furthermore, every new vector generation procedure opens the possibility to fasten our method. Additionally, the property of conjugacy which underlies some iterative procedures and which is valid only in linear problems, in our case is not absolutely necessary. Therefore, the method can be successfully applied in nonlinear calculations in which the conjugacy is not even defined. This fact is really important, because in the case of nonlinear practical applications, iterative methods are used exclusively. Finally, applying our original method based on integer arithmetic, the exact solution of appropriate, practical, realistic (not just simple, benchmark) examples can be determined, so we can evaluate the convergence, stability and accuracy of any numerical procedure, including the method proposed. 					 				|	|Basic engineering sciences|	|fast iterative method, Ritz method, sparse matrix storage, accuracy estimate, generalization of iterative methods|

Recent advent of detector arrays allows systematic studies of nuclei away from the region of nuclear stability. With the proper selection of colliding systems and reaction energies, the exchange of nucleons can lead to the population of neutron-rich nuclei, peculiar systems having challenging aspects in their nuclear structure behaviour. The main objective of this research project is to advance understanding of the nuclear reactions and structure in the vicinity of the neutron drip line. By the use of the new generation instrumentation, we will experimentally study three different neutron-rich groups of nuclei: very heavy nuclei (difficult to access experimentally with other methods), medium-mass nuclei (where well known magic numbers disappear), and finally, lower mass nuclei (were the neutron drip line has already been experimentally reached). The major part of the proposed experimental work will be performed at the top international accelerator facilities, but in the well suited cases, the measurements will be performed at the RBI accelerator. The new experimental data will significantly improve our understanding of nuclei far from the stability line and will have a considerable impact on the reaction measurements at next generation of the radioactive beam facilities. Scientists involved in this project are active members of a number of leading international collaborations in the field, with large experience in experimental research and considerable international reputation. Project PI has remarkable research track record and has led a successful project before. Senior scientists on the project have led a number of competitive projects (funded by MSES, FP7, ESF and Croatian SF).

Croatian transformer manufacturers are among a top few in the world, and their annual production is worth about €300 million, what is about 2% of the world production.

Notable progress in technology of transformers is based on utilization of new materials and application of advanced design methodologies, which incorporate sophisticated numerical methods for modelling of processes in transformers. This project is focused on research and development of advanced numerical techniques for solving various electromagnetic phenomena in transformers and their application in design. Crucial subjects in transformer design are: insulation system, electromagnetic losses and windings. Consequently, researches within this project are organized in three subprojects: 1. New methods for design of insulating systems. The aim of this subproject is to develop new comprehensive numerical method for computation of electric fields within the insulating system. 2. Computation of electromagnetic losses with the aim to develop a new method of estimation of stray losses level of power transformer, as well as the methodology of simultaneous modelling of electromagnetic field, thermal field and fluid dynamics field in transformers. 3. High frequency modelling of windings. The objective of this subproject is to develop fast and accurate procedures for the determination of capacitances, inductances and resistances in high-frequency range. These elements will be used for creating an equivalent lumped-element circuit for determination of voltage stresses along a winding. The overall goal is to reduce dimensions of transformers and to increase their reliability by application of new methods and procedures. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|numerical methods, transformers, insulation systems, lossess, high frequency modelling|

Current model suggests that after the series of desaturation and elongation processes in endoplasmic reticulum C24:6n3 is synthesized, transported to the peroxisome and then shortened to 22:6n3 via one cycle of ß-oxidation and transported back to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification into the appropriate phospholipids. Plasma and tissue DHA values are determined by dietary intake, competition for enzymes between n3 and n6 line and by the endogenous fatty acid metabolism, which could be dysregulated by diabetes. Nevertheless, the complexity of synthesis currently prevents correct prediction of DHA content in the tissues of diabetic animals. In this project, we will investigate the influence of n-3/n-6 ratio and DHA supplementation in insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus on DHA metabolism, mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation and DHA metabolome. Our assumption is that nutritional modulation can override insulin influence on diabetic dyslipidemia which could have profound influence on the treatment of diabetes. Additionally we will try to find enzymes of mitochondrial and peroxisomal ß-oxidation which could influence DHA metabolism by nutritional modulation. Trials will be performed on rats with induced diabetes which will receive dietary treatments with different n3/n6 ratios and increased DHA content. Integration of results from experiments will define the behavior of DHA in different types of diabetes. Investigations on subcellular level will allow us to determine the influence of diabetes on peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta oxidation and DHA metabolism. Investigation of DHA metabolome will link nutrition, diabetes and bioactive DHA products. Finally, data from the whole project will result in integration of knowledge and better understanding of DHA biosynthesis. 					 				|	|Veterinary medicine|	|docosahexaenoic acid, dyslipidemia, diabetes, peroxisomes, oxidation, nutrition|

Within the problem of active and passive damping optimization and optimal control of parameter dependent mechanical systems with and without external force, we will develop a general theoretical framework. These theoretical considerations will be related to the optimization of various damping parameters with respect to a several different optimization criteria. Furthermore, within the stated objectives we will solve many numerical demanding problems: mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, efficiently solving of large matrix equations (Lyapunov, Sylvester, Riccati), improving the optimization algorithms by dimension reduction. We will also consider theoretical and numerical aspects of optimization of semi-active damping problem and optimal control based on various criteria. Within the problem of describing the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the parameter-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problems, we will develop perturbation theory for the corresponding quadratic problem separately for cases when the corresponding linearized pair is diagonalizable or definite.

The all mentioned problems are closely related, thus the insight into the behavior of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will allow better understanding of the behavior of mechanical systems and vice versa. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|large-scaled parameter dependent mechanical systems, nonlinear eigenvalue problem, damping optimization, optimal control, matrix equations|

The first will include study of mechanisms of organic reactions in the solid state, and the second will mainly deal with the theoretical study of mechanisms in the solution. Mechanisms of the solid-state processes cannot be interpreted using the established concepts of reaction mechanisms because the phase change plays the crucial role in determining reaction kinetics and the structure of the products. Until now, papers published in this field represent mostly kinetics of phase transformations and descriptions of kinetic data by various mathematical models. As a result, the relationship between such a macroscopic approach and structural changes on the molecular level is still poorly understood. Knowledge about the principles of solid-state reactions is of broad interest, and especially useful to chemists who use solvent-free synthetic methods. In this research, we propose investigations of solid-state reactions based on our recent discoveries and explanations of mechanisms of dimerizations and polymerization of nitroso compounds. Using this established approach and corresponding molecular models, we plan to develop a mechanistic concept of the solid-state reactions, and use it to design novel supramolecular structures. As a starting point of our investigations of organic reaction mechanisms in the solution, we will finish development of our new cluster-continuum solvation model. It will provide us with the most important solute-solvent molecules clusters, allowing the realistic estimates of standard Gibbs energies of involved species and thus prediction of kinetic and thermodynamic data for the examined reactions. The approach will be tested on several model problems, and then used for the analysis of several representative organic mechanisms, including the ones occurring in solids. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|reaction mechanisms, solvent effects, solid-state reactions, molecular self-assembly, nitroso compounds, ferrocenes|

The project will focus on studying two major pesticide classes with three subgroups per each: (A) insecticides (organophosphates, neonicotinoids, and pyrethroids), (B) herbicides (triazines, organophosphates, allelopathic), and persistent organochlorine pollutants under the Stockholm convention. Low concentrations corresponding to real-life exposures will be evaluated based on residential exposure levels, occupational exposure limits, acceptable daily intakes, and reference doses in appropriate cell lines and animal models. The malsegregation of chromosomes (X, Y, 9), integrity of gatekeeping genes (TP53, c-Myc), and protein structures (cytoskeleton components) will be studied within the transplacental genotoxic evaluation of selected pesticide groups. Among these, some are suspected to be endocrine disruptors. Potential effects on sex hormone levels will be assessed in neonatal rats and transfer via mother’s milk in pubertal rats. Oxidative stress will be estimated by measuring lipid peroxidation and activity of antioxidative enzymes in vitro and in vivo. We will study the processes affecting the distribution of pesticides in water/soil systems as well as the genotoxicity of their residues in soil and water. Results for low levels of pollutant exposure will serve to significantly extend the knowledge on their genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, sex endocrine disruption, mechanisms of oxidative stress, and distribution in the environment. Also, they will be used as a base for amending and adopting the Croatian National Action Plan for sustainable use of pesticides in accordance with demands postulated in Directive 2009/128/EC and the EU Thematic Strategy for Pesticides. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|pesticides, organochlorine pollutants, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton, environmental distribution, risk assessment|

The project OSCITON focuses on two oscillatory processes. First, we will investigate the mechanism of microtubule-driven kinetochore oscillations during mitosis, and the role of kinesin-8 motors in this process. These oscillations generate tension between sister kinetochores, which is required to pass the spindle checkpoint. We will use HeLa cells expressing tubulin-GFP and mRFP-CENP-B, a kinetochore protein, in combination with advanced light microscopy and depletion or overexpression of kinesin-8 motors. To study the forces acting on kinetochores, we will perturb the force balance by performing laser microsurgery of the microtubules attached to kinetochores. The experiments will be accompanied by the development of a theoretical model, which will allow us to explore the role of kinesin-8 in the oscillations. Second, we will study the oscillatory repolarization of Dictyostelium cells during random migration. We propose that the competition of DGAP1/cortexillin and SCAR/Wave complexes for the common activator Rac1 plays a central role in this process. To test this hypothesis, we will use a novel fluorescent probe for active Rac1 GTPases, generate cells with disturbed balance of Rac1 effectors, and cells deficient in functional Rac1. Dynamics of the probes for Rac1, its effectors, and F-actin will be studied experimentally in live cells and theoretically. This interdisciplinary project is designed to optimize the use of resources and bring together researchers with the expertise in a range of disciplines, including molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, microscopy, and theoretical biophysics. Through joining forces of all investigators of the cytoskeletal dynamics in Croatia, we intend to assemble a team that will play a prominent role in this field of research internationally. 					 				|	|Biology|	|cytoskeleton, microtubules, motor proteins, mitotic spindle, cell migration, Rho GTPases, microscopy, theoretical modeling|

Cholesterol, sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids are the major constituents and organizers of lipid rafts. At least 11% of transmembrane proteins depend on glycosphingolipids, particularly gangliosides, as lubricant enabling proper raft location and function. Changes in composition of glycosphingolipids interfere with fine tuning of critical physiological processes like adhesion, signaling, forming barriers, cell migration, vesicular transport and apoptosis. Although changes in the ganglioside content of lipid rafts are the first sign of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson, mechanisms causing changes are not fully explored and there are no relevant clinical treatments targeting rafts in neurodegeneration or regeneration. With this proposal we aim to test whether the content of lipid rafts is disrupted in knockout mice for the key enzymes in ganglioside synthesis, affected in stress and aging and could it be successfully tuned by pharmacological manipulation. In order to test this hypothesis we will map the changes in lipid rafts and the transcriptome of CNS and PNS of ganglioside-deficient knockout mice and rat models of aging and chronic stress. Potential pharmacological substances, inhibitors of key enzymes in glycolipid metabolism, will be synthesized and further selected according to their efficacy to affect the composition of lipid rafts in cultured neurons and the mouse models. Combinations of lipidomic and transriptomic approaches will be used to select critical signaling pathways which would be tracked down to epigenetic changes. Genetically, environmentally and pharmacologically introduced changes in lipid rafts would give insight in their function and enable development of drugs for fine tuning of processes like stress responses and regeneration. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|lipid rafts, gangliosides, nervous system, glycolipid inhibitor, stress, epigenetics|

Patients with IBD, despite the absence of scientific evidence, often avoid certain types of food; however the effect of those self-imposed diets has not been determined. This is especially important in children whereby insufficient diet could have long-term consequences on growth and development. Therefore, the first objective of our study is to determine the frequency of self-induced diets in children with IBD and their impact on: a) nutritional status by using clearly defined parameters and b) course of the disease. The study will include newly diagnosed patients with IBD and healthy controls. 2. Intestinal microflora. It has been hypothesized that the excellent therapeutic effect of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) on pediatric active Crohn's disease (CD) could be explained by the effect on intestinal microflora. However, well performed studies are lacking. Therefore, the second objective of our study is to determine the difference in gut microflora at diagnosis and after remission induction achieved with EEN. Patients’ intestinal microflora will be compared with the microflora of healthy siblings before and two days after both groups receive EEN. Furthermore, in children with CD the intestinal microflora will be determined after 6 weeks of EEN and during the first year of follow up. 3. PED-IBD Registry. The incidence and natural history of pediatric IBD in Croatia has not been determined yet. The third goal of our project is to establish a national registry of children with IBD by providing an on-line database that will contain relevant clinical and diagnostic factors on all newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients. To achieve this goal data will be entered at diagnosis and after one year of follow up. Multivariate analysis, which will include clinical and therapeutic parameters, will be used to determine risk factors for early disease relapse. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|inflammatory bowel disease, children, enteral nutrition, incidence, registry|

Graphene can withstand rather large elastic deformation and it appears that within the elastic response there is a range of different modifications in graphene’s electronic structure. This is a basis of what is called “strain engineering”. Recent theoretical calculations suggest that uniaxial strain or shear deformations can induce opening of the electron band gap, anisotropic modification of the Fermi velocity, spin-orbit interaction and consequently alter the transport properties. However, there is still no consensus on the mechanical conditions required to obtain a particular electronic modification. In this project we propose a systematic study of structural and electronic properties of periodically rippled graphene. We have already demonstrated that graphene conforms to the stepped (vicinal) iridium surface – Ir(332) creating periodic structure at nanometer scale. It is aim of this project to experimentally explore the dependence of the electronic structure of graphene with respect to periodicity of the graphene corrugation, orientation of the graphene with respect to the shear deformation (zig-zag with respect to armchair direction). By intercalation of different elements we will alter the graphene substrate interaction with the aim to control the structure of the underlying surface and consequently valence band structure of graphene. We shall investigate structural properties of graphene on Ir(332) by Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The focus in the investigation of electronic properties will be on the ARPES study of anisotropic distortion of the Dirac cone, relation with the direction of the graphene modulation, spin-orbit interaction and on the possibility to induce electron band gap. 					 				|	|Physics|	|graphene, strain, vicinal surface, fermi velocity, spin-orbit coupling, STM, ARPES|

This project will submit the current situation to an interdisciplinary analysis and provide a suggestion of a future scaffolding that will be possible both in legal and in economic terms, at the same time grant the end-user benefits of personalized medicine, biotechnology and cutting-edge research. New biotechnologies are the source of challenges on different levels. In the widest perspective, they promise to bring about the clash of globalization, Europeanization and transition. Focusing on the EU in particular, they may bring about changes in the open methods of coordination and shake up the European social model. The national social state is also likely to be affected. The project will therefore gather biotech, legal and economic experts to deliver a platform for identification of challenges posed by development of new technologies in the field of medicine to the society in general; the way the new technological advances may affect the development of a constitutional democracy and the way the mechanisms of this democracy may affect the new technologies. Important social, regulatory, legal, ethical and moral issues will be analysed within this Project. A central issue to be covered is therefore finding adequate ways for a proper communication between scientists, health care providers, patients and health insurance providers, who all need to understand what they are dealing with in order to define their roles and responsibilities. The objectives of the project address scientific, policy, infrastructure and education issues. Specific recommendations include: road mapping (defining research agendas); funding (define future Joint programming projects); education; synergies (creation of inter-disciplinary networks); knowledge transfer and communication; impact (through wide dissemination in journals, books, etc.). 					 				|	|Law|	|transition, social security system, biotechnologies, personalized medicine, reform of the social state|

It is the keystone climax species of forests which harbour high biodiversity and consequently has priceless ecological and social value. Survival of the specie’s populations in southern and southeastern Europe is endangered by predicted climate extremes such as prolonged drought. These populations are the “rear edge” of the species distribution range and their phenotypic response and adaptive capacity to climate change have not been well studied. Research will be carried out on progenies and plant samples derived from European populations sampled along a latitudinal environmental gradient. The focus of the research will be placed on populations from the southern and southeastern part of the specie’s distribution range. We aim to compare adaptability, epigenetic and phenotypic responses to drought stress of southernmost populations with the populations from the central and northern part of the specie’s distribution range. The main scientific objectives of the proposed project are to determine: 1) neutral genetic diversity and structure of selected pedunculate oak populations along a latitudinal gradient; 2) their epigenetic diversity and structure; 3) their epigenetic response to long-term drought stress; 4) their physiological, phenological, morphological, biochemical and growth (i.e. phenotypic) response to drought stress; 5) their adaptive genetic variability, differentiation and plasticity; 6) current ecological niche preferences and main environmental variables driving its distribution 7) its future distribution under climate change scenarios based on ecological niche modelling and which parts of the contemporary distribution will suffer from decreased habitat suitability induced by climate change; 8) levels of the studied populations adaptability by comparing their adaptive genetic variability, plasticity and epigenetic response. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|phenotypic plasticity, genetic variability, climate change, ecological nishe, rear distribution edge|

A prerequisite for this progress is the complete understanding of the Standard model (SM) predictions. One of the triumphs of SM physics has been the extent to which QCD successfully describes strong interaction processes observed at colliders. More accurate QCD calculations are nowadays essential in understanding the enormous amount of available high-precision data, particularly since new physics effects are obscured by standard QCD processes. Our focus in that area will be to improve the description of hard exclusive processes by including higher-order contributions and by further developing the corresponding methods for automatic QCD calculations. Furthermore, we plan to do precision studies of top-quark production and decay observables which provide a unique view to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, important for understanding of particle mass generation. In the top-quark decay the information about its spin polarization imprinted by the production process is preserved, and can be calculated and measured in angular distributions of decay products providing other way to search for deviations from the SM expectations. Regarding new physics, the fact that neutrinos have a mass already requires an extension of the SM and calls for an understanding of the origin of neutrino masses. The seesaw mechanism, included in a theory as the one where left-right symmetry (parity) is restored at accessible LHC energies, stands out as a prominent theoretical candidate, and this theory links the origin of neutrino masses to new interactions at high energies and to the restoration of parity. A phenomenological investigation of these predictions is thus compelling and timely. 					 				|	|Physics|	|theoretical particle physics, Standard Model, perturbative calculations, physics beyond Standard Model, neutrinos|

Abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought are the primary causes of crop loss worldwide. Phytohormones are crucial for the plant ability to adapt to abiotic stress by mediating a wide range of adaptive responses: photosynthesis modification, increased antioxidant activities, secondary metabolites accumulation, changes in gene expression. Phytohormone auxin regulates the majority of plant stress responses through interactions with stress hormones salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and brassinosteroids (BRA). The aim of this proposal is to investigate the abiotic stress responses of selected Brassica crops (Brassica rapa. ssp. pekinesis, Brassica oleracea var. capitata and Brassica oleracea var. acephala) to drought and salinity stress through integrative research approach comprising biophysical methods of photosynthesis measurements, biochemical methods of stress diagnostics, metabolomics (plant hormones and secondary metabolites) and molecular functional research. Particular focus will be placed to the role of auxin and its interactions with stress hormones (SA, ABA, JA and BRA) in stress responses and potential mechanisms of tolerance. Phytohormones auxin, SA, JA, ABA and BRA will be analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS. Secondary metabolites, polyphenols and glucosinolates will be measured by spectrophotometry and UHPLC-MS/MS. In order to shed light on auxin homeostasis in abiotic stress, functional research will be performed by using Arabidopsis thaliana lines for genes of auxin reversible conjugation (GH3 and ILR). Results of hormonal analyses will be correlated with basic physiological and biochemical parameters (photosynthesis parameters, ROS level, antioxidant enzymes, proline, glutathione, protein carbonyl level).

Measurement of bulk enzymatic activity in water samples is a good proxy for the metabolic activity of planktonic communities. However the basis to understand how such ecosystems function and how planktonic communities react on natural and anthropogenic changes is detailed knowledge on how each functional unit (species) of the plankton community functions. Such knowledge will allow to understand how each component (species) contributes to the bulk community functioning and more important how changes in ecological conditions will change the community structure and subsequently the ecosystems functioning. So far such detailed analyses are not systematically undertaken. In this project we will achieve species resolution in metabolic analysis and understand the respective lifestrategies that make the most prominent phytoplankton species successful competitors in the P-limited system of the northern Adriatic (NA). We chose the NA as a well investigated and understood marine shallow ecosystem. This project investigates the metabolic adaptations to P-limitation as they are the most prominent adaptation in the NA. We will concentrate our investigations on microphytoplankton as it is taxonomically well defined and accesible to our research teams expertise and range of methods and as our preliminary results show the microphytoplankton to be the dominating component of the plankton community in the NA. Our preliminary research did uncover a variety of mechanisms that allow microphytoplankton to thrive in steep ecological gradients and generally P-limited conditions. A combination of modern and classical methodologies (ecology, oceanography, cell biology, advanced microscopy, taxonomy, phylogenetic analysis, molecular biology, biochemistry) as well as a comprehensive ecological (long term) database for the region will allow us to uncover the complex set of microphytoplankton lifestrategies. 					 				|	|Biology|	|Phytoplankton, alkaline phosphatase activity, northern Adriatic, phosphate limitation, life strategy|

Besides excellent genotyping and sequencing opportunities, the inclusion of subjects from the isolated island populations facilitates gene discovery and enables the search for the rare genetic variants. After completion of genome-wide association and exome analysis, we will also use gene networking and pathway analysis tools, as well as the advanced analytic tools, such as random forest, lasso regression and partial least squares regression in order to produce results that can be translated to clinical medicine, fitness and beauty, as well as legal medicine and forensics. Progress over the existing research designs will also be achieved by inclusion of extensive confounding information and family structure into analysis. All these findings will also be investigated in follow-up measurements and linked with the morbidity and mortality information in the future, thus further developing a coherent resource capable of producing highly competitive research results.

It will investigate overlaps and interferences between different cultures of memory in Central Europe, along with possible points of convergence in (joint) structures of literary production. Special attention will be paid to the Habsburg Monarchy and its successor states in the last two centuries – from the beginnings of the modern nation building process to the subsequent disintegration of multi-ethnic state formations. The term ‘empire’, being key to our research, is borrowed from geopolitical historiography and also applies to other empires in the region, which are relevant in the aforementioned temporal and spatial context. The concept implies a complex network of social, political and economic relations within the state, established and ‘translated’ through constructions of ‘cultural difference’ and asymmetrical power relations. Thus, ‘empire’ can also be understood as a complex cultural ‘story’ told by the political and cultural stakeholders: a type of narrative construct structured differently in different contexts and often used to describe or explain certain social / historical facts. Accordingly, not only national, but also supranational, i.e. imperial, cultures should be studied as ‘narrative communities’ differing from each other mainly through their cultural story-telling reservoirs. In order to exemplify this, our research project will be based on the study of literature as a medium of culture with the unique capacity to represent, affirm and undermine constructions of cultural memory and processes of both individual and collective identity formations. For conclusive results, we will address the following research questions: 1) how processes of national homogenization and imperial claims function in the medium of literature, 2) how they come in contact and, 3) how they can be instrumentalized for concrete political, ideological or aesthetic purposes. 					 				|	|Philology|	|Postimperial narratives, Central European literatures: Croatian, Austrian, Hungarian, modern period, dichotomy center/periphery, Habsb. postcolonial|

On the other hand, the traditional distribution channels usually generate surpluses that can be effectively used to decrease problems of poverty. Research studies show that Social supermarkets, as a new retail, are becoming increasingly important factor in reducing poverty across Europe throughout more efficient distribution of generated surpluses of goods. Social supermarkets at their core purpose and mean of operations are substantially different compared to the traditional retail formats, and in the current scientific literature they have not been sufficiently investigated so far, especially in Central and Eastern European countries. As social supermarkets base their operation on philanthropic foundations, volunteering and donations, and already in some markets significantly affect the structure of revenues of the traditional retailers, this topic requires a multidisciplinary approach in order: (a) to clarify their current position and their impact the general socio-economic situation in the particular markets, (b) to investigate the legal framework that has been established by those countries in which social supermarkets reached a high level of development, particularly in the area of tax legislation and consumer rights legislation, (c) to assess management issues regarding work organization of volunteers or employees, and (d) to explain particular problems of the effective organization of input logistics and distribution of goods and services within social supermarkets. Therefore, the project team will include experts from the fields of retailing, retail management, management of nonprofit organizations, corporate finance, fiscal systems and social work from several scientific institutions from four Central and Eastern European countries. 					 				|	|Economy|	|retailing, retail formats, social responsibility, social supermarkets, social innovations|

Among more than 200 different autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology, University of Zagreb, only five Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins. This research is intended to clarify the role of S-layer proteins in cells of Lactobacillus species, particularly in important probiotic properties such as adhesion, competitive pathogen exclusion and interactions with host immune system. Researches will also be directed towards bacteriocin production by autochthonous LAB strains, mode of antimicrobial action, as well as the induction of bacteriocin production. Isolated autochthonous LAB strains will be further examined for their physiological and technological properties important during their selection as functional starter cultures. Since artisanal fermented foods are a rich source of new and potentially interesting microbial strains with considerable genetic, metabolic and technological properties, well-defined autochthonous LAB strains, produced as microencapsulated and lyophilised functional starter cultures, will contribute to safety and quality of traditional food fermentation processes and to formulate innovative functional products.

Aware of the high cultural value of the state-funded music education system in Croatia, as well as an indispensable role of musical metalanguage in teaching music at all levels, the PI Nikša Gligo has noticed an array of doubtful basic musical terms appearing within the above mentioned system. The discrepancies among teaching professionals are so present that it often comes to misunderstandings and other difficulties in communication. The objectives of the project will be to locate problems through analysis of recent corpus of professional literature in the field, to analyse the variants in the use of musical metalanguage among teaching professionals, to compare the Croatian musical terminology with other languages, as well as to propose alternative solutions for inappropriate basic musical terms in daily use. The main aim of the project is to make available to public a set of 2000 standardized and harmonized basic musical terms in form of a free internet database and a published handbook. Further dissemination will follow in form of terminology workshops and seminars throughout Croatia. This interdisciplinary project will be achieved through intensive cooperation of musicologists and linguists, which will ensure a high level of linguistic normativity along with musicological aptness.

Aberrant P signaling has been associated with reproductive conditions, cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular defects, and neurological defects. In humans and mice the physiological effects of P are mediated by two intracellular receptors, termed PR-A and PR-B, expressed in subset of cells in target tissues. PR-A and PR-B isoforms are transcribed from a single gene by alternative promoter usage. PR-A (94 kD) isoform differ from PR-B (120 kD) by lacking 164 amino acids at the N terminus . Analyses to date have shown that PR-A and PR-B mediate mostly distinct but partially overlapping reproductive tissue selective physiological responses to P. The overall objective of this research is to establish the selective physiological roles of each of the individual PR isoforms in their natural physiological context. For this research we will use a genetically modified mouse in which gene targeting was used to knockout expression of either the PR-A or PR-B isoform in mice. The specific aims of this application are as follows: 1. To examine the isoform-selective molecular mechanisms by which PR-A and PR-B differentially regulate uterine epithelial proliferation, uterine receptivity and stromal decidualization. 2. To examine the selective contributions of the PR-A and PR-B isoforms to the P dependent immunomodulatory activity during early pregnancy. 3. To identify progesterone-regulated genes in musculoskeletal tissue using a genetically altered mouse models lacking progesterone receptors. 4. To determine whether differential signaling pathways of PR isoforms are conserved from rodent to human. It is expected that this research will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of P in reproductive tissues and musculoskeletal and could lead to new strategies for disease prevention and treatment. 					 				|	|Public health and health services|	|Progesterone, progesterone receptors, uterus, bone, physiology, pathophysiology, animal model, human|

As the first experiences with SEM almost invariably precede first sexual experiences, concerns have been raised about its potential impact on young people’s sexual socialization, subsequent reproductive and sexual health outcomes, as well as motivation and capacity for building and maintaining relationship intimacy. The field of socio-behavioural research on SEM has been marred by inability to distinguish between associations and causal links. The only available European panel study followed Dutch youth for only 12 months. To enable a more robust assessment of the links between SEM use and sexual socialization, health, and intimacy we propose to set up a 3-year panel sample with over 1,000 high-school students. The panel would be used to carry out biological testing on males (testosterone levels from saliva) and repeated online surveying in which the genre and the frequency of SEM use would be analyzed as predictors of subsequent sexual activity (particularly, sexual risk taking), the dynamics of attitudes toward women and committed relationships. We propose to test a conceptual model in which possible SEM influences on the outcomes are influenced by T levels, personality traits, family environment, characteristics of ego-centered social network, type of SEM used, and sexual experiences. Our biopsychosocial model aims to assess the contribution of SEM use to the process of young people’s sexual socialization, while controlling for the effects of biological makeup, intrapersonal characteristics, and interpersonal and group (family, peer group, partners) social influences. The proposed project is innovative in design and analytical conceptualization. The expected outcomes should be relevant not only in scientific terms but also in the context of public policy, particularly in the area of educational and public health interventions. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|Prospective study, panel, young people, reproductive and sexual health, emotional intimacy, committed relationships, sexually explicit material|

We shall study QDs made of different semiconductors embedded in various dielectric materials. The main intention is to explore many of basic physical properties of such systems which are not clear yet and hence prevent their successful development and application. The several key issues that we shall explore are: a) the process of nucleation and growth of QDs, their self-assembly and self-organization. We shall study experimentally and theoretically nucleation growth and crystallinity of different QDs in various dielectrics, and possibility of superstructures formation. Once formed QDs present several serious challenges. The interface QD/dielectric and/or the structure of dielectric layers close to QDs as well as its impact on optical and electrical properties is still completely obscured. In this respect we shall study radiative and nonradiative recombinations of carriers in this region by PL and TRPL. A special effort will be given to theoretical modelling of interfaces, defect formation on such interfaces modeled with molecular dynamics and attempts to describe the transport properties with such modelling. Finally, electronic properties of such composite material will be explored by transport measurements and compared to several simulation models. Several models of unbiased and biased percolation will be explored and applied to this problem. Finally, formation of metal nanoparticles and their plasmonic effect will be explored and analyzed as a special approach to the light management. 					 				|	|Physics|	|nanoscience, quantum dots, percolation conductivity, tunneling, photoluminescence, scanning probe microscopy, small angle x-ray scattering, modeling,|

Croatia occupies a key position between eastern and western Mediterranean basins and delimits central European and the Mediterranean regions influenced by different climates. Dinaric karst, covering half of the Croatian territory, offers exquisite potential for such a research, having the wide range of karstic forms already proven as good (paleo)environmental archives, such as terrestrial and submerged speleothems, tufa deposits and lake sediments in karstic lakes and marine algal rims in the coastal area. Within this research various carbonate sediments from different climate zones will be studied: speleothems from 3 locations in littoral Croatia, mountainous Gorski Kotar region and central Croatia, lake sediments from Plitvice Lakes, tufa deposits from Zrmanja River, and marine algal rims from ~8 locations along the eastern Adriatic coast. Research will be based on isotopic methods that include analyses of stable isotope ratios 13C/12C and 18O/16O in carbonate deposits, 2H/1H and 18O/16O in water, and radioactive isotopes 14C and U-Th series for dating. Stable isotopes in carbonates will provide information about past environmental conditions, temperature variations, lake evaporation, bioactivity and productivity, and indicate the origin of carbon and mechanisms of calcite precipitation. Algal rims serve as good and precise sea-level indicators and additionally their morphology, age and stable isotope composition could be directly linked to climate changes. The expected outcome is the estimation of regional response of the environment in Croatia to global changes during the Quaternary, and of differences in response of various carbonates to paleoenvironmental changes and their correlations. The project combines groups from Ruđer Bošković Institute, Faculty of Science (Univ. of Zagreb), and University of Zadar. 					 				|	|Geology|	|paleoclimate, paleoenvironment, Quaternary, speleothem, algal rim, tufa, lake sediment, stable isotopes, 14C dating, U-Th series dating|

During the last decades attention has been focused on their early diagnosis and prevention. Diabetes related metabolic abnormalities: insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia along with oxidative stress and low- grade inflammation contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction and macrovascular complications. Recent investigations indicate a potential role of adipocitokines originating from visceral adipose tissue: adiponectin, leptin, resistin and dipepetidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP-4) activity in the development of microvascular complications in diabetes. The association of these adipocitokines with the activity of endothelial synthetase (eNOS) involved into the metabolism of nitric oxide (NO) was documented in animal and cell culture studies. We hypothesize that lower adiponectin and higher leptin and resistin plasma concentration and DPP-4 activity are associated with the development and progression of diabetic microvascular complications by endothelial function impairment. Four hundred patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be included in this prospective study. The association between adiponectin, leptin, resistin plasma concentration, DPP-4 activity and endothelial markers: NO, von Wilebrand factor (vWF), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) on the development and progression of microvascular complications will be assessed. Our results will provide further insight into the complex pathophysiology of microvascular complications in diabetes. A possible identification of new markers of their development and progression will contribute to improved diagnosis followed by an individualized patients approach. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|adipocitokines, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular complications, diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2|

Recent data indicate that some of key features of malignancy are similar to normal processes of embryonic development, which are programmed and highly regulated. The subpopulation of cancer cells that exhibit properties of embryonic stem cells are called cancer stem cells (CSCs) and studies showed their essential role in resistance to radio- and chemotherapy, tumor dormancy and metastasizing. We aim to investigate malignant characteristics of mesothelioma that are driven by programmed processes associated with the regulation of pluripotency, and which can be modified by exogenous treatment. Our overall hypothesis is that the resistance to oxidative stress and chemotherapeutics in mesothelioma cells is regulated by the activity of oncogenic pathway PI3K/AKT/BCL2. It will be investigated whether this pathway can be controlled with master regulators of pluripotency and differentiation by reprogramming mesothelioma cells. Mesothelioma cells will be reprogrammed to pluripotent state with introduction of defined factors yielding induced pluripotent mesothelioma stem cells (iPMSCs). iPMSCs will be differentiated into three different lineages. This will allow us to determine whether such experimental perturbation decreases activity of the specific oncogenic pathway PI3K/AKT/BCL2 that may control mitochondrial cytoprotective pathways. Ultimately such intervention may render cells more sensitive to oxidative stress and chemotherapeutics. In vitro studies will be corroborated with clinically relevant histopathological examination of patient’s tumors where correlation among differentiation status, PI3K/AKT/BCL2 pathway activity and patient’s survival will be examined. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|stem cells, pluripotency, reprogramming, malignant mesothelioma, cytoprotection, oncogenes|

The status of social science and its influence on the development of society are less researched themes in comparison with natural and applied sciences. Nearly a quarter of registered Croatian scientists are social scientists. Their work is, in most part, tied to the work of 7 scientific institutes and all 7 universities. The main research questions in this project are: Which themes and problematic are central to these experts? Where do they publish the results of their research? How much do they cooperate on institutional, country and international level and are there measurable effects of cooperation? To what extent are their results available and recognized through citations? What is the significance and role of national journals in social sciences? What are the differences between various fields of social sciences? To provide a rich comparative description of the state of social sciences in Croatia, the project includes 10 EU post-socialist countries as well as ex-Yugoslav countries. To attain its goals the project will use quantitative (bibliometry, survey, social network analysis) and qualitative (interviews) methods which have been planned and will be implemented by a multidisciplinary team of experts. The primary source for bibliometric data for productivity, impact, authorship, cooperation, journals, institutions and countries will be the Scopus citation index. The main source for statistical data about the included countries will be Eurostat and various national sources. The expected outcomes of the project are theoretical and applied, from insight in scientific potential of social science research in included countries, through the development of appropriate methods of collecting and analyzing different types of data, to offering the relevant elements and indicators for the evaluation of scientific output and as help in related decision making processes. 					 				|	|Information and communication sciences|	|research performance, citation analysis, collaboration, social network analysis, natioanl journals, social sciences, Croatia, EU countries|

Targeted samples are unexplored or insufficiently investigated honeys, honeydews, bee-products, wines, cheese, others. While characteristic NPs (secondary metabolites) already possess flavours, other flavour compounds can derive from precursors during processing, fermentation, dry-curing, heating, others (e.g. Maillard reactions, Strecker degradations, retro-aldol reactions, Amadori rearrangements, heterocyclizations, lipid oxidations and others). NPs/FLs isolation involves application of selective preparative procedures followed by the organic analysis applying modern chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Specific project goal is to determine reliable chemical fingerprints of targeted samples depending on biodiversity of natural sources in different regions. Varieties of acetate, shikimate, mevalonate and/or deoxyxylulose biosynthetic pathway derivatives are expected to be found. Among them, it can be possible to find specific or nonspecific chemical biomarkers characterizing certain sources. In addition, the obtained NPs or selected samples will be evaluated in order to unlock their potential, particularly antioxidant activity by different assays and corrosion inhibition potential with in-situ and ex-situ electrochemical/non-electrochemical techniques. Project work plan includes: 1) the samples selection and preliminary characterisation; 2) set-up of preparative/chromatographic/spectroscopic methods followed by elaboration of the obtained chemical fingerprints); 3) set-up of antioxidant/corrosion inhibition assays followed by unlocking the samples/NPs potential; 4) training of young researchers/cooperation. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|natural products, flavours, preparative techniques, chromatography, spectroscopy, antioxidant assays, corrosion inhibition assays|

It means that the project discusses contemporary Croatian dialectal situation of organic idioms and the genesis of Croatian dialects, on one side, and the Croatian linguistic heritage as written (recorded) in literary works and other linguistic monuments, on the other side. It is expected that the project will offer scientific results of great importance. They mainly refer to seven monographs written by five authors, and to other contributions, too. All those contributions will enrich the (present) knowledge about the Croatian language from Istria to Dubrovnik and from Gorski kotar to the western part of Srijem, as well as elsewhere, i. e. in the areas where the Croatian speaking population is present or was present in the past. It could be expected that the project would improve the Croatian genetic linguistics, first of all the study of the Kajkavian and Čakavian dialect, and then the Croatian dialectology as a whole. It means that speeches of the Štokavian dialect will also be entirely included in the research, as well as the idioms of the Torlakian dialect spoken by Croats. It is particularly important that the work on this project will considerably improve the quality of scientific activity of each scientist engaged in this project (member of this project team), particularly of junior researchers.

Adequate wastewater management implies collection and treatment of wastewater, but also adequate management of waste substances generated in the treatment process. Joining the European Union Croatia has made the commitment to construct all treatment plants of capacities over 10.000 PE by 2018. This will result in putting into operation of treatment plants with the total load of about 4.000.000 PE (250.000.000 m3 of wastewater), which will generate about 215.000 tons per year of raw sewage sludge and after incineration around 49.000 tons per year of incinerated sewer sludge ash (ISSA). Taking into account that EU Directives are limiting the amount of sewage sludge waste to be landfilled, and Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) puts reuse and recycling of waste into the most favorable position, it is evident that enormous amount of ISSA will become available for appropriate management. The composition of the generated sewage sludge and ISSA is dependent on the technology of wastewater and sludge treatment. Reviewing the available knowledge in this field leads to the conclusion that the influence of the method of incineration on physical properties of ISSA and the technology of preparing and processing of concrete and concrete elements has not been fully analysed. The main objective of the project is to investigate the possibilities of recycling the sludge from WWTPs in preparing of new innovative products in concrete industry. Based on comprehensive experimental research and multidisciplinary knowledge of the partners (hydrotecnical, materials and chemical engineering), a strategy will be proposed for the comprehensive and sustainable management of ISSA and its transformation from unwanted waste material into valuable resource for production of construction products with ecological, economical and technological benefits. 					 				|	|Civil engineering|	|Wastewater treatment, Sewage sludge, ISSA, Concrete, Microstructure, Sustainable materials|

Viral and bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, autoimmunity or chemical irritants cause inflammatory changes that stimulate cancer initiation, promotion and metastasis. We and others have shown that main molecular links between inflammation and cancer are cytokine IL-6 and its transcription factor STAT3. It is becoming obvious that microbiome composition of particular niche is important element of inflammation and cancer development. The role of inflammation in urinary bladder cancer (BC) pathogenesis is poorly understood although chronic inflammation caused by Schistosoma haematobioum has pro-tumorigenic effect while acute inflammation caused by BCG is successfully used as a therapy for BC. To investigate the role of inflammation in BC development we will use BBN induced BC mice models and will study: (1) the role of IL-6 (by using IL-6 KO mice); (2) the role of STAT3 by assessing its targeted deletion in mice urothelium and (3) therapeutic potential of STAT3 inhibitor. Additionally, we plan to (4) test importance of microbiome in BC development by using mice BC model and antibiotic treatment to manipulate bladder microbiome composition and to (5) analyze human bladder cancer microbiome, in order to associate BC with specific microbiota. This project addresses fundamental questions of bladder cancerogensis. If altering STAT3 activity has inhibitory effect on BC development that finding can lead to new therapies (use of STAT3 inhibitors) for established BC. Findings generated by the microbiome analysis can lead to novel preventive measures (microbiota manipulation by antibiotics or vaccination). Team members are experienced scientist with publications in Cancer Cell and Nature Genetics which is securing successful realization of the project. Because BC is the seventh most common malignancy, proposed project is of great medical, social and economic importance. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|bladder, cancer, inflammation, microbiome, STAT3, IL-6|

However, in spite of intensive studies and remarkable discoveries, many fundamental aspects of the HSV-1 biology are unknown. Recently, with expansion of transcripome analyses, it become apparent that non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), including miRNAs and long ncRANs (lncRNA), have immense role in regulation of genes of animals, plants and viruses. We have discovered numerous miRNAs expressed by HSV-1, functions of which are mostly unknown. On the other hand, a few HSV-1 encoded lncRNAs have been discovered many years ago, including intensively studied latency associated transcript (LAT), but function of these remains largely elusive and not investigated. We hypothesize that miRNAs and other ncRNAs have a central role in virus gene regulation and efficient establishment of latency, particularly the control of the lytic-latent switch (reactivation from latency). We seek to determine the complete ncRNA transcriptome of HSV-1 and understand its roles in regulation of gene expression during lytic and latent HSV-1 infection. Our study is founded on preliminary data focusing on small set of miRNAs, i.e. functions of miR-H1 and miR-H6, HSV-1 miRNAs abundantly expressed during lytic infection and/or latent infection. We have generated the HSV-1 mutant with miR-H1/H6 locus deleted, and our results indicate that these miRNA are important for virus pathogenesis. Using bioinformatics and cutting-edge molecular biology techniques we will identify targets of this and other miRNAs and reveal their function in infection. Moreover, to enable high-throughput technologies in studying latency, we will establish an in vitro latency model. In preliminary attempts, we have characterized the expression of HSV-1 and host miRNAs in such models. This approach will also allow sensitive probing of the latent/lytic switch and biochemical approaches to study ncRNA-protein interactions. 					 				|	|Biology|	|microRNA, miRNA, virus, latency, herpesvirus, herpes simplex, gene regulation,|

An impressive number of settlements of this type can be found in Istria, representing an interesting scientific and important cultural phenomenon. Most of the hillforts were established during the Bronze Age, and due to population increase and social stratification they were transformed from simple settlements into pre- and proto-urban centres. While the ethnic identity of the Bronze Age population is still unknown, the ethnically uniform population of the Histri inhabited these settlements during the Iron Age. After the Roman conquest of Istria most hillforts were abandoned; some of them remained in use, but under different circumstances and conditions which led to their substantial modification. Despite the large number of these sites (240 confirmed, 200 hypothetical), few of them were systematically excavated. Previous research was limited to intra-site interpretation and to targeted field survey. The main goals of this project are to identify anthropogenic landscape change at the time of the conversion of site function, and to obtain new insights on the spatial organisation of settlements and their relationships with the surrounding environment. Landscape studies, geoarchaeology, topography and archaeology will be integrated under interdisciplinary GIS environment, providing a new holistic interpretation of past landscape dynamics. This research will fill the gap in the understanding of human-landscape interaction and of anthropic transformation of land from Late Prehistory to Roman times. A case study on human impact on landscape will be conducted in the micro-region of Poreč, and will be explained within its broader regional context. The project will also provide training for young researchers involved in PhD programmes, giving them the chance to develop interdisciplinary skills and encouraging them to become successful independent scientists. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Istria, prehistoric hillfort, ancient landscape, roman villa, geoarchaeology, GIS, spatial analysis|

From Late Hellenistic period when Central Dalmatia was enrolled in vivid Mediterranean trade, not only as a receiver of everything that comes from the larger centre, but also as a driving force of social and economic changes establishing pottery manufactures. This social transformation was enhanced by Romans. Trade of ceramic objects is one of the main starting points for understanding the history of the Roman economy and society. For such scientific research it is necessary to establish a project using archaeometric analysis and archaeological research and a database of ceramics. Landscape archaeology methods such as field surveys, GIS, sampling patterns and statistical analysis will be used to analyse and interpret the wealth of data. RED project will include the development of an online database of documentary, archaeological material and archaeometric samples. Aim of this project will also be to establish relations between local production to the imports and to what extent was production in province Dalmatia driven by consumer demand and involvement of provincial communities within the Late Hellenistic/Republican and Imperial Roman economy. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Roman economy, Dalmatia, pottery, landscape archaeology, archaeometry|

The study will consist of analysis and reconstruction of two, by its purpose, different Water System, one of typical urban character and another very specific of Emperor Palace. Unlike the Water System of the Palace, which is partly preserved (aqueduct is in function) and therefore more studied, the Water System of Salona is mostly unknown. They will be studied separately using the same methodology. All parts of Water Supply system will be studied: water intake on Jadro spring, route and elements of the aqueduct (channel, bridges and tunnels), water distribution tanks, lead pipe network and water appliances together with water quantity and quality issues. The study of sewage will consider wastewater and storm water drainage, as well as the protection from external surface water and groundwater. Besides those, methods, materials and techniques used by Roman engineers to establish efficient urban Water System indispensable for the life and health of the citizens will be analyzed and compared with modern system. The study will be based on collecting all data regarding explored elements of the Water System and on new archaeological excavations financed by this project. Existing topographic and architectonic surveys will be summarized and supplemented by new ones which will enable reconstruction of the whole system and elements.

However, for the repetitive elements organized in tandem, known as satellite DNAs, role in gene regulation is not described till now. In the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera) satellite DNAs play an important role in heterochromatin regulation and remodelling during development and environmental stress response. Expression of a major satellite DNA is strongly induced by heat shock, and increased level of satellite-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is accompanied by increase of repressive epigenetic modifications of histones at heterochromatin. In addition to their presence in the heterochromatin, short stretches of satellite DNA have been mapped in the close vicinity of numerous genes within euchromatin. The environmentally susceptible transcription of a major satellite DNA as well as its distribution close to protein-coding genes provides strong support for the role of satellite DNA in gene regulation and adaptation to different environmental conditions. The aim of the proposed project is to investigate the gene-regulatory role of satellite DNAs in insect T. castaneum. We propose that satellite DNA-associated siRNAs could affect epigenetic state of euchromatic regions containing dispersed satellite elements by targeting these elements in a sequence-specific manner and by guiding chromatin modifiers, primarily histone methyltransferase. This could result in heterochromatin assembly at dispersed satellite DNA elements and its spreading to the flanking region. Such “heterochromatization” is expected to influence the expression of nearby genes, most probably by decreasing the level of gene expression. We expect that our results will for the first time demonstrate a role of satellite DNAs in the modulation of protein-gene expression and in environmental adaptation. 					 				|	|Biology|	|satellite DNA, gene expression, epigenetics, gene regulation, adaptation, Tribolium|

The breed is black in color, resistant and convenient for keeping in extensive and half-extensive conditions. It is also characterized by good meat quality, suitable for producing typical traditional meat products. Recently, the traditionally produced food came into the focus which led to more often use of geographical indications (protected designation of origin-PDO, protected geographical indication-PGI and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed-TSG) as the valuable rural development strategy. Since Black Slavonian pig is a late maturing breed characterized by low lean meat percentage, meat processors tend to use the meat of modern pig breeds in production of traditional products. Therefore there is a need for scientifically developed methods in order to trace the origin of materials used in such production. First of all, molecular identification of breed will be performed by the use of MC1R gene and 18 microsatelite primers . Since the genotype, age and sex are possible sources of variation of the meat quality traits in pigs, the objective of proposed research is to determine the optimal time for slaughter with respect to these factors. The genetic influence on meat quality traits is nowadays well described by the use of molecular markers by which many of the candidate genes were discovered. In proposed research a special interest will be placed at some of them such as IGF2, MC4R, H-FABP3 and LEPR. The investigation of sensory traits and chemical analysis of meat and meat products will help to determine the typical physico-chemical characteristics and sensory profile of autochthonic Slavonian dry-cured meat products and fresh meat originated from Black Slavonian Pig meat. At the end, obtained polymorphisms at the microsatellite loci will be tested in identification of the origin of meat used in the production of traditional meat products. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|indigenous pig breed, genomic identification, growth characteristics, carcass and meat quality, sensory traits, meat products, branding|

However, although we are aware of certain changes our understanding of their origin and consequences is still very limited. Long-term data series are a key to this understanding and hard structures of marine organisms, including bivalve shells, present an important archive of environmental data potentially extending decades or even centuries into the past. Sclerochronology is an emerging interdisciplinary field that enables obtaining of marine environmental data from bivalve shell structural elements as well as their geochemical composition. These data are of great importance for understanding of the marine ecosystem-level process and responses to climate variability. Our motivation for the project is, by applying modern sclerochronological methods, to construct chronologies for three relatively long-lived bivalve species (longevity about half-century), living in the eastern Adriatic Sea. Target organisms include dog cockles Glycymeris glycymeris and G. bimaculata, and a smooth clam Callista chione. These chronologies will be analysed in parallel with long-term in situ and climate model oceanographic data, in order to quantify environmental effect on the bivalve growth. Further on, the oceanographic data will be used for portraying of ocean dynamics and processes that occur over interannual and decadal timescales in the Adriatic-Ionian basin and are important for growth of all marine organisms. The project will grow from two relatively independent topics, sclerochronology and ocean physical (environmental) sciences, merging them in an interdisciplinary manner in the later stage of the project execution. The project is highly interdisciplinary, while the project team is transnational. 					 				|	|Biology|	|climate change, sclerochronology, Bivalvia, ocean dynamics, marine ecology|

Recent data from the Planck mission show that our Universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. One of the major efforts in particle physics today is to reveal the composition of the dark matter. Nowadays, it is known that neutrinos constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, while the rest is made of yet unobserved particles theoretically predicted in various extensions of the Standard Model. Two leading dark-matter candidates are the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), and the axion - a light pseudoscalar associated with the spontaneous breaking of U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry, a mechanism originally introduced to explain the absence of CP violation in strong interactions. This concept has been generalized to further axion-like particles (ALPs), which may arise as Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the breaking of various global symmetries. Possible dark matter candidates also include so-called WISPs, i.e., a variety of sub-eV (or slim) weakly-coupled particles such as hidden-sector photons and chameleons. A large number of theoretical ideas and hypotheses have been put forward to explain what the dark mater particles are, but only experimental data will be able to answer which, if any, of these ideas is correct. In the proposed project we are planning to continue and extend searches for axions, ALPs, and WISPs in experiments CAST (CERN Axion Solar Telescope) - currently the most sensitive axion helioscope in the world and its successor IAXO (International Axion Observatory). The discovery of such particles would be a ground-breaking result for particle physics since it would be a clean evidence of physics beyond Standard Model, but even in case of non-detection, CAST and IAXO will be able to exclude large parts of yet unexplored regions of the relevant parameter spaces for these particles. 					 				|	|Physics|	|experimental physics, dark matter, axion, axion-like particle, weakly interacting slim particles, CAST, IAXO|

There is a constant growth of this trend in Croatia, whereby certain areas, or to be more precise, the coastal area is more exposed to second homes expansion. This increase in pressure of second homes and the tendency of this phenomenon to change and take new forms, especially under the influence of the expected growth of international second homes and disappearance of the hierarchy in the use of dwellings, have directed the planned project towards one question: are second homes only an obstacle, or could they be a source of opportunities, i.e. an additional impulse to the social sustainability of local communities in Croatia. The main objectives of the project are: 1) Identifying settlements in Croatia with an increased number of second homes; 2) Determining types of settlements in Croatia, and getting an insight into the connection of second homes to relevant sociodemographic and socioeconomic features of the settlers; and 3) Analysing how second homes affect the daily life of the local community, social structures and processes in it. These objectives direct the research towards combining secondary analysis of the census data and the analysis of the empirical data gathered through case studies. This will enable a deep insight into the way second homes affect the local social reality. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|second homes, social sustainability, local communities, leisure, Croatia|

Unfortunately, their construction is extremely costly and rarely guided by practical considerations, posing a problem especially for less-resourced languages. One possible solution is to rely on crowdsourcing of lexico-semantic resources. Although crowdsourcing has proven to be a viable option for reducing the overall costs, there still does not exists a comprehensive crowdsourcing methodology for incremental construction of large-scale lexico-semantic resources. This projects aims to fill this gap by investigating the computational models and methods for incremental and cost-efficient crowdsourcing of lexico-semantic resources. The research will combine dynamic crowdsourcing, corpus-based models of semantics (distributional semantics and topic models), and active machine learning methods into a comprehensible and language-independent crowdsourcing framework, the SenseHive. The SenseHive consists of a flexible, graph-based representation of senses and lexico-semantic relations (SenseGraph), coupled with an incremental construction methodology. In SenseGraph, senses are dynamically split up and merged based on the analysis of human judgments on corpus-extracted data. In the first phase, we will implement a prototype of the SenseHive framework and use it for focused evaluation experiments on Croatian, Slovene, and English data to answer the relevant research questions. As a proof of concept, in the second phase we will use SenseHive to construct a medium-sized lexico-semantic resource for Croatian by enlarging and enriching existing lexico-semantic resources. The proposed research will advance the state of the art in computational lexical semantics and semi-automated construction of linguistic resources, and yield a lexico-semantic resource for Croatian of great practical value. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|Obrada prirodnog jezika, jezične tehnologije, leksička semantika, semantički resursi, razrješavanje višeznačnosti, hrvatski jezik|

It is known that serotonin (5HT) - mediated mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity, but results from recent studies utilizing genetic perturbations of the serotonin system are often at odds with the historical notion that increased 5HT bioavailability leads to body weight reduction, and highlight the need to better understand integrative mechanisms at work during lifelong alterations in 5HT signaling. This project is aimed to study the impact of constitutionally altered activity of 5HT system on the regulation of hypothalamic-adipose tissue axis that regulates energy balance. For this purpose we plan to use an original animal model, Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rats, developed in our laboratory by the use of selective breding toward extreme activities of peripheral 5HT transporter, a key regulator of 5HT bioavailability. As a result of genetic selection two sublines of the model, high-5HT and low-5HT subline, show constitutional differences in central and peripheral 5HT homeostasis. One of the consequences of genetic selection is also a markedly overweight phenotype of high-5HT animals. We will investigate biological basis of interplay between increased 5HT tone and adiposity in the hyperserotonergic subline, and their functional consequences. Studies at the molecular level will be focused on the expression of adipocyte- and hypothalamic-derived peptides, their receptors and downstream signaling as well as transcriptional factors and cofactors involved in the regulation of adipogenesis and energy homeostasis in general. Studies on the whole body level will include investigations of the functional responses of 5HT sublines to specific physiological challenges - susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and capability for cold-induced thermogenesis. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|serotonin, obesity, adipocytes, hypothalamus, leptin, animal model|

Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is the only member of sirtuin family linked to longevity in humans. In addition, important cellular and mitochondrial processes, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation are integrated through SIRT3. The excessive production of ROS leads to oxidative stress, a crucial event that contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and age-related pathologies. Females show lower incidence of some age-related diseases that is attributed to protective effect of sex hormones. Estrogen (E2), a female sex hormone, has well established cytoprotective effect during oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms by which E2 is protective remains elusive. Although E2-dependent protection includes improvement of mitochondrial function, it is not clear whether SIRT3 participates in these events. We propose that sex-related resistance to oxidative stress occurs by E2-dependent improvement of mitochondrial function, mediated by SIRT3. We aim to define the role of SIRT3 on mitochondrial function in E2-dependent resistance to oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. To validate this hypothesis we will utilize pharmacological, dietary and genetic approaches to establish role of SIRT3 in E2-dependent resistance to oxidative stress. These informations will indicate if direct link between E2, SIRT3, mitochondrial function and resistance to oxidative stress exists. Successful completion of these specific aims will contribute to mechanistic understanding of the role of mitochondrial fidelity protein SIRT3, as a potential pharmacological target. Moreover, distinguishing the pathways involved in beneficial and detrimental effects of E2 is crucial for developing drug therapies that will help to retard aging with only minimal deleterious effects caused by E2 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|sirtuin, mitochondria, estrogen, ROS, aging, oxidative stress|

Even, the power and energy national standard is missing. The SMAGRIMET will be main centre for research and development of necessary metrological infrastructure in Croatia for smart grid and related scientific fields that will effectively bridge the gap between the Croatian metrological infrastructure and European counterparts. Most of the European metrological institutes have contributed to the European Smart grid metrology project in which Croatia has not taken part because of the lack of infrastructure for measuring power and energy and related issues related to smart grids. The research will be focused in developing highly accurate voltage and current transducers, using precision sampling devices and using new algorithms to accurately analyse measurement data. This research project addresses a series of metrological challenges that will provide essential support to ensure security of electricity supply and grid stability, grid quality, and fair trade between commercial parties employing the grid. The challenges are many: Measurement framework for monitoring stability of smart grids, traceable on-site energy measurement systems for ensuring fair energy trade, remote on-site measurement of power quality and efficiency and modelling, simulation and network analysis of the system state of smart grids-. Also the introduction of the new standard IEC 61850 will change the way the substation will function in the future.

In the sociological tradition, the “slippery” concept of “class” has been used to theorise and research social inequalities. The adjective “slippery” is used to signal running debates on whether class is still a viable analytical concept, as well as debates surrounding diverse traditions of conceptualising class. Contemporary debates range from neo-Marxist and neo-Weberian perspectives to revitalised versions of Bourdieu’s class model, as well as more micro-level approaches in class analysis including research on the “psychic economy of class”. This project is inspired by Bourdieu’s work on social inequalities. Bourdieu’s (1992) class analysis consists of two “moments”: the construction of objective structures by identifying the distribution of resources (cultural, economic, social) that act as external constraints bearing on practices and the exploration of how people subjectively (re)create these structures. In other words, there is a focus on identifying “objective” class locations, as well as how these locations are practised in routine activities; this is the approach taken up by this project. Questionnaire data on people’s economic, cultural and social capital will be collected from a nationally representative sample of people living in Croatia, on the basis of which a class model of Croatian society will be developed. In addition, 120 life story interviews with a purposive sample of women and men living in different regions of Croatia and occupying different class locations will be conducted. The purpose of the interviews is to explore how class works biographically, both in terms of self-identification, everyday practices and at times of crisis. The mixed methods approach will enable the exploration of both structural and subjective aspects of social stratification. 					 				|	|Sociology|	|stratification, class, Bourdieu, inequalities, mixed methods|

Thus, the proposed program is in a great deal determined by, and directed towards, effective exploitation of the observational capacities and manpower of HO. The project is divided into five thematic topics: 1) solar activity and eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere; 2) solar-activity impact on the Earth; 3) stellar eruptive activity; 4) radiation processes in solar and stellar atmospheres; 5) exoplanets and substellar companions. In the first topic special attention is devoted to the research of the physics of coronal mass ejections and solar flares, since they drive the most intense geomagnetic storms, as well as changes of radiation belts and ionosphere. The central issue of the second topic is the influence of the solar variability on the Earth climate. The third topic is devoted to stellar eruptive magnetic-field activity, aiming to provide a better understanding of the long-term evolutionary aspect of the solar activity. The fourth topic is an important subject not only for astrophysics, but also for plasma physics in general, since it provides an alternative view on plasma instabilities and emission processes. The fifth topic is a timely astrophysical theme, since it provides new insights into physics of planetary systems, and is very important subject for understanding of the solar-system formation and evolution. 					 				|	|Physics|	|solar activity, space weather, climate, heliosphere, sun-like stars, variable stars, binary stars, accretion discs, exoplanets, substellar companions|

Achieved models and tools for investigation enable wider application of results in economy. Furthermore, Quaternary deposits are direct results of ancient climatic conditions and hence understanding them can help interpreting and predicting actual events. The goal of this Installation Research Project is to establish a group of researchers in the Croatian Geological Survey (CGS), Department of Geology, to additionally equip and train them, so they could standardise and carry out their research of Quaternary sediments of Croatia applying new analytical techniques and new scientific findings. Those new compositional data will enable correlating our results with the EU, especially for the middle and south Europe. In this project we would like to deal with Quaternary sediments on the both regions: Pannonian and Dinaric. During the first year we plan to get know new equipment, methodology and to investigate all the different types of Quaternary sediments in Croatia. In the second and third year plan is to scrutinize the sediments in selected area in the each region (Pannonian and Dinaric). The strategic importance of Quaternary sediments for Croatia is based partly on the agricultural utilization of the Holocene soils developed on these deposits and partly as a collector of drinking water, reflecting to the whole biosphere. Furthermore, the hydrogeological properties of separate horizons of Quaternary sediments are different, so, insight in the structures of sediment layers could lead to finding new water resources. 					 				|	|Geology|	|Quaternary, litostratigraphical unites, Croatia, spatial distribution, climate proxies|

The interplay between dust, gas and stars is present throughout stellar and Galactic evolution, from star and planet formation until ultimate final stages in supernovae explosions. In the era of precision cosmology and of search for life on other worlds, stellar astrophysics has become extremely relevant. We address a number of important topics in the various stages of stellar evolution and interaction of stars with their circumstellar and interstellar environment. Our principal objective is probing stellar evolution models. With sophisticated methods of spectral disentangling we pioneered and upgraded we are able to measure metallicity of the stars in binaries with the high precision and breakdown the main obstacle in comparing empirical data to models. We plan to analyse benchmark binary stars along the mass sequence to provide the stringent tests of different stellar evolution models and parametrise efficiency of rotational mixing, convective core overshooting or mixing length. Radiative transfer calculations in dusty envelopes and protoplanetary disks, including MHD calculations in boundary star-disk region would be performed with a high spatial resolution which is enabled by the code LELUYA devolped by one of us. Ab initio quantum density functional theory calculations would enable identifications and composition of interstellar dust nanoparicles from IR and X-ray spectra obtained on-board space telescopes. This is is the first attempt to organise dispersed astrophysical research in Croatia into more focused direction. The research team is assembled with the Croatian scientist from 6 Croatian and 2 foreign institutions including all the four major Croatian universities. We hope this would promote collaborative research and make astrophysical research in the country more coherent and better organised. 					 				|	|Physics|	|stars, binary stars, stellar evolution, accretion disk, protoplanetary disk, spectroscopy|

These issues are especially relevant in vocations in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), which are technologically sophisticated and important for the development of the society. Since 1990s the interest of youth for these vocations is declining. Researchers, national governments and authorities like EU operate with exact figures which clearly demonstrate a shortage of STEM graduates and a decline in number of STEM experts. The proposed project is grounded in contemporary theories of academic achievement, self-competence beliefs and vocational interests and it is structured around three main research goals: (i) to examine how students’ general and specific STEM career aspirations are formed and how they change over time; (ii) to examine how students’ academic achievement and self-competence beliefs are related to their general and specific STEM career aspirations and how the pattern of relations among them changes during the course of primary schooling; (iii) to examine how students’ general and specific STEM career aspirations are shaped by their families and gender. The project is based on a longitudinal research design, as a suitable methodological framework for responding to these complex research questions. A total of 1920 primary school students and their parents/guardians will participate in the study. Students will be grouped in three age cohorts, which will be followed longitudinally through three measurement waves. The additional goal of the project is to implement a STEM intervention program in primary schools and evaluate its’ effects by using two-group pre- and post-test randomized experimental design. The project is intended to create new knowledge useful for researchers, students, teachers as well to create knowledge-based implications for relevant stakeholders. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|STEM, vocational interest, school achievement, self-concept, self-competence beliefs, longitudinal studies, effectiveness of interventions|

We commonly use stochastic models to describe such behaviour and rely on stochastic methods to gain insights, make forecasts or inference about them. Various stochastic methods have appeared over the years in biology, medicine, biomedicine, geology, climatology, social sciences, finance and insurance, and many other scientific fields. The area of mathematics that lies in the background is probability theory, in particular, theory of stochastic processes. It is a rich mathematical theory with proven potential to solve not only applied problems, but also some quite theoretical problems coming from other areas of mathematics. The problems that we plan to study can be broadly divided into four groups: 1. Analysis and potential theory of Markov processes, 2. Stochastic methods in modelling heavy tailed phenomena, 3. Stochastic methods in harmonic analysis, and 4. Stochastic methods in biomedical and social sciences problems. This choice of problems is influenced by importance in the current international research as well as the background and expertise of members of our team. The goal of the project is to advance understanding of the role of randomness in each of these four settings. The unifying feature behind our approach to these problems is common stochastic methods in their analysis. These methods include, but are not limited to, martingale methods, point processes and random measure methods, potential-theoretic methods (both probabilistic and analytic), Markov processes methods, methods from the Dirichlet form theory, stochastic integrals, diffusion processes, branching processes and measure-valued processes methods, time-series methods, wavelets and methods for statistical inference. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|stochastic methods, stochastic processes, Markov processes, martingales, heavy tails, point processes, branching processes|

So far, the ways of communication between these regions were not of primary interest of archaeological scientific work. The complete work in defined area, combining field survey, trial excavations and data concerning natural resources, hasn’t been done. The goal of this project is the recognition of strategic points of settlement in prehistory and later periods and reconstruction of ways of communication. The project will concern itself with the area of municipalities Našice, Podgorač, Drenje and Koška (Drava region). This area is recognized as a potential crossroad of ways of communication of our interest. The work will be divided into 4 stages including field survey, trial excavations, data collection from geological maps and satellite images, combining data, web site construction and presenting the results in form of exhibitions, conferences, lectures etc. The final publication will be made presenting goals, collected data, the final results and list of museum activities.

Phase diagrams of layered cuprate, organic superconductors and manganites, as well as some other transition-metal systems, famous for the phenomena of unconventional superconductivity (SC) and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), respectively feature an extraordinary complexity of electronic phases, which can be tuned by chemical composition, magnetic field and pressure. A prominent place among these phases is held by stripes, patterns of charge order (CO), which are thought to be linked to SC and CMR, as well as by CO phases with ferroelectric signatures due to a rich variety of nonlinear properties and complex dynamics. Despite intense research efforts, these basic issues in condensed matter physics bear many open questions. We propose to investigate the nature of charge/spin-ordered phases and their motion developed in series of organic and transition metal solids applying modern experimental tools available at the Institute of Physics, Zagreb and at the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb (dielectric spectroscopy, pulsed nonlinear conductivity, ac/dc resistance, magnetoresistance and Hall effect). Our overall contributions to the field and our expertise in condensed matter physics have been internationally recognized. Together with the available experimental means, this positions us as researchers fully suitable and competent for the proposed task. Our international partners will give an added value with samples, experiments and expertise in the terahertz and infrared spectroscopy. Integrated students and postdocs are going to acquire advanced skills in the materials science and learn to solve complex problems in a collaborative environment. Results will be published in international scientific journals and presented at international conferences. 					 				|	|Physics|	|correlated electrons, unconventional superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, charge and spin orderings, quantum spin liquids, nonlinear effects|

Importance of negative hyperconjugation, contribution of the leaving group to the height of the reaction intrinsic barrier, importance of the inductivity and resonance as well as solvation will be analyzed. Series of substituted phenyl and alkyl carbonates, phosphates, phenolates, sulfates, phosphorous ylides, quaternary ammonium salts, etc. will be subjected to solvolysis in aqueous solvents and the rate constants will be correlated with the electrofugalities of the generated carbocations by applying a special LFER equation: log k = sf (Nf + Ef). To detect changes of the C—H bond strength in the TS, secondary deuterium KIEs will be determined. The rates of the backward combination reactions in some cases will be measured, which will provide a complete free energy profile of some reactions. The Marcus intrinsic barriers will be calculated and analyzed. The existing electrofugality scale will be extended with other aromatic (e.g. ferocenyl) as well as non-aromatic electrofuges by introducing the correction factors for the solvolysis rates. Such extended electrofugality scale, not limited to aromatic derivatives only, will allowed estimation of the heterolysis rates for wide range of compounds. The quantum-chemical model will be developed which mimics heterolysis reactions and whose barriers for variety of leaving groups correlate well with experimental barriers obtained with benzhydryl derivatives (?G‡calc vs ?G‡exp). By applying this correlation, the nucleofugality scale will be extended considerably and estimation of the rate constants for SN1 solvolysis of numerous leaving groups will be enabled. Such interplay of the theoretical calculations and experiment will allow prediction of the reactivity of a huge number of new nucleofuges, which have not been used earlier, as well as design of the substrates with required reactivity. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|nucleofugality, electrofugality, kinetics, solvolysis, reactivity|

This can also be used to develop more rational rules and regulations related to the traffic of large ships operating in the Adriatic and to investigate possibilities of a ship structural design improvement with respect to the most dangerous incident types. Despite advancements in navigation systems, ship accidents continue to occur, the most recent one being the grounding of a cruise ship Costa Concordia. These accidents have resulted in the loss of cargo, pollution of environment, and most unfavorable the loss of life. Accidental damages of ships can occur in any number of ways. The two cases which exhibit most concerns are the collision between ships and hard grounding on seabed. When a ship is damaged, the operators need to decide on immediate repair actions by evaluating the effects of the damage on safety of the ship by considering simultaneously effects of the damage in the hull girder ultimate bending moment and in the applied loads (wave and still-water induced bending moments). In general, as the consequence of an accident still water loads on ship will considerably increase, while the ship strength will decrease. Disaster of the tanker Prestige in 2002 clearly showed that the ship in damaged condition can be broken due to the above mentioned phenomenon and sink as the most unfavorable outcome of such an accident with likely spillage of a large amount of pollutant oil on board. Since the Adriatic is an enclosed sea basin, with the low level of the activity of the sea waves and current, an accident of the oil tanker with significant oil spill would make irreversible ecological disaster with enormous economic losses. Therefore, safety of oil transportation in the Adriatic is a major concern of the whole society. 					 				|	|Naval architecture|	|oil tanker, Adriatic sea, damaged ship, structural reliability, risk assessment|

Correlation between PR and the severity of the disease has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension, but not in much more frequent, type II pulmonary hypertension. The results might contribute to the knowledge of the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, with potential therapeutic implications as we intend to examine whether the changes in PR modulate the response to vasoactive prostaglandin E1.

In connection with the proposed investigations it will be necessary to synthesize a large number of well defined and in some cases extremely complex molecules which will certainly ask for substantial innovations in the synthetic methodology and development of the existing techniques. The scientific goals of the project will go beyond the state of the art and search for bio-medical applications. A series of compounds will be screened for antiproliferative activity, providing lead molecules for further research and potential development of cancer treatment with minimal side effects. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|photochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, carbenes, polycyclic molecules, phthalimides, quinone methides|

Such systems exhibit a complex array of morphologies and dynamics and have a huge potential for new applications in areas ranging from materials science to medicine. The bottom–up synthesis of highly complex functional materials from simple modular blocks is an intriguing area of research. These hierarchically assembled systems extend beyond the individual molecule and rely on non-covalent interactions in a directed self-assembly process. Intrinsic properties of the materials can be modified by exploiting dynamic and specific uni-directional interactions among building blocks, thus allowing construction of novel supramolecular structures. These supramolecular networks belong to a novel category of soft biomaterials exhibiting attractive properties. Research in this project will include the formation of dynamic polymeric networks through molecular recognition and complex assembly formation. Self-assembly of small organic molecules is a suitable method for synthesis of organic nano-structured materials. LWM organo- and hydro-gels with oxalamide units represent construction units with high H-bonding potential; they are self-complementary, capable of unidirectional H-bonding suited for construction of self-assembled with fibrous morphology. In continuation of our previous research the attention will be focused on two main areas of research 1. nanofabrication; preparation of new materials by polymerization through cross linking the gel network or transcript to the TEOS and development of new organic materials that incorporate photoactive functional groups, and 2. bioinspired supramolecular systems for detection and degradation of fibrous supramolecular aggregates, such as Aß-protein and amyloid plaques (that are a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease) and vesicles functionalization for surface molecular recognition studies. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|Supramolecular Chemistry, Self-Assembly, Gels, Hydrogels, Functional Materials, Nanomaterials, Molecular Surface Recognition, Complex Chemical Systems|

Long term Croatian economic policy and development stem from both short term policies and long term sustainability. By combining macroeconomic and development policies, the long term objectives of sustainability of natural resources, public sector economics, demographic changes, spatial economics and overall economic structure may be achieved. Thus, the goals of this research stem from the above stand point, and include: • Establish development policies for Croatia based on sustainable use of natural resources • Show how change of age structure in Croatia affects fiscal sustainability and short and long run economic development • Explore how three way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and movement of factors of production affect international, regional and urban development • Analyze structure of Croatian economy suitable for sustainable and deeper integration into the EU • Define integrative policies which lead to sustainable development of Croatian economy For achieving above mentioned goals, the project team is separated into four equally contributing groups and is structured as follows: 1. Sustainability of economic development within the context of scarce natural resources. 2. Sustainability of public sector economics and the labor market in the context of demographic changes in Croatia. 3. Sustainability of the degree of centralization in the context of spatial (international, urban and regional) economics. 4. Sustainability of current economic structure within the context of the EU integration Outcomes of the research will be innovative approach to controversy of long vs. short term development and stability, as well as integrative approach to different, and thus far, insufficiently interconnected fields of economic research. 					 				|	|Economy|	|sustainability, economic structure, resources, public sector economics, spatial economics|

Proposed project addresses the EU targets as defined by European Commission’s “Europe 2020” strategy for smart growth by focusing on research and development of highly-integrated and energy efficient optical transceivers and wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) components for next-generation of access and mobile backhaul networks using passive optical network (PON) infrastructure. The primary challenge, in wider adoption of WDM-PON, lies in the development of sufficiently low cost technology to be used at the users’ premises. Self-seeded WDM-PON has been actively investigated in recent years as potentially the lowest cost solution for next-generation access networks. The primary attraction of this architecture is its simplicity, lower power consumption, and cost advantage. Similar principles can be applied to multiplexing and interrogation systems for optical sensors and our aim is to develop, analyze and demonstrate sustainable all-optical infrastructure based on extended cavity resonators able to provide physical layer for both, access communication and sensor networks. At University of Zagreb we invented an optical component, the modulation-averaging reflector, which reduces the penalty due to modulation of the seeding light and depolarizes the light oscillating in the cavity thereby stabilizing the extended resonator. This was the first step towards a future-proof optical access technology. Within this project we will fully develop and characterize systems based on extended cavity resonators with modulation averaging reflectors. We will also explore the use of modulation averaging concept in a novel communication optical source architecture based on wavelength re-use. Finally, the concept of extended cavity resonators will also be implemented in non-communication applications such as new optical sensor schemes. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|optical access networks, WDM-PON, optical sensors, colorless optical transmitter, extended cavity, optical noise, noise reduction, wavelength re-use|

All these agricultural byproducts are abundant, cheap, non-food competing and renewable polysaccharide-based feedstocks. In this project, agricultural waste lignocellulosic raw materials will be hydrolyzed by thermal, chemical or enzymatic methods or their combinations in order to obtain adequate disintegration of raw materials. Studies of bioethanol and LA production will be performed by the semi-solid or solid state fermentation in the new constructed horizontal rotating tubular bioreactor (HRTB). The most suitable microorganisms for bioetahnol and LA production will be identified and improved by genetic methods. Studies regarding suitable purification methods for all three bio-products will be performed in order to obtain pure compounds for theirs further practical use. Integration between production and separation bioprocess stages will be also examined in order to improve ecological and economical aspects of these bioprocesses. The sustainability of bioethanol and LA production will be evaluated through the realization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The most efficient and sustainable bioprocess configuration will be determined and consequently scale-up procedure will be proposed. The scale-up procedure will be based on the developed integral bioprocess mathematical model and other scale-up criteria.

SOA is an architectural style that provides guidelines for development of loosely coupled distributed systems. The concept relies on services, self-contained applications which can be consumed using well-established interfaces. One of the most pronounced benefits of SOA is the ability to combine multiple services into a component-based application (service composition). Despite having clear advantages, service composition development entails issues when it comes to reaching both the required functional and non-functional application goals. Specifically the current research results do not offer an answer how to build service compositions efficiently when faced with large service repositories and very complex service workflows. The goal of this project is to put forward a comprehensive recommender system aimed at simplifying development of service compositions by assisting developers in reaching both functional and non-functional application goals. Our previous research efforts, demonstrate that designing such a recommender is feasible. As part of this project we want to extend the preliminary research with novel recommender methods suited for SOA-based systems. Regarding functional properties, the proposed recommender is to facilitate automatic service recommendations based on the morphological structure of the constructed application. Furthermore, the recommender is to utilize knowledge sharing technologies to assist in enlisting most adequate human help. In the domain of non-functional properties, a set of methods used to determine reliability of atomic services based on statistical approaches will be applied. Finally, a method for efficient improvement of service composition’s non-functional properties will be utilized. 					 				|	|Computer sciences|	|recommender system, service-oriented architecture, service compositions, development assistance, functional and non-functional properties|

One in three of the population develops cancer at some time in their lives and one in four dies from this disease. The main problems in antitumor chemotherapy are drug resistance and side effects on normal tissues. In the recent years a tremendous growth was witnessed in synthesis and development of vast number and types of new heterocyclic antitumor agents, with an emphasis on creation of new drugs with better selectivity or activity. The latter are indeed major requirements in development of novel anticancer drugs. The proposed scientific project is highly interdisciplinary and objective-oriented with the principal aim to develop the novel lead compounds with pronounced and selective anticancer activity that would be used for further phases of drug development. To achieve the principal aim following specific tasks are foreseen. The goal of the first one is to synthesize small-compound library (Classes A–H) comprising new conjugates of pseudopurines, coumarines and quinolines with 1,2,3-triazole scaffold, N-acyclic 5-unsaturated pyrimidine derivatives, amino-, amido- and amidino substituted benzimidazole, benzothiazole and benzo[b]thieno-2-carboxamide derivatives. Molecule library will be synthesized using modern synthetic approaches such as click chemistry, palladium mediated cross-coupling, eco-friendly microwave assisted and photochemical reactions as well as classical organic synthetic methods. The aim of the second task is to predict plausible biological targets and pharmacological activities using cheminformatics/in silico analysis. The third task is to perform cytostatic evaluations based on which hit molecules with desired biological effect will be selected for structure optimization that will be subsequently carried out. Finally, the molecular mechanism studies are anticipated for the most effective compounds from synthesized N-heterocycles library. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|1,2,3-triazole-heterocycles hybrids, benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, synthesis, cytostatic activity, in silico and docking analysis, DNA binding|

Metal nanoparticles have novel electronic, optical, magnetic, medical, catalytic and mechanical properties owing to their high surface to volume ratio and the quantum size effect, which depend greatly on their size, structure and shape. Therefore a conservative estimation of the world market predicts the global consumption of metal oxide nanoparticles to rise from 270 tons in 2012 to 1700 tons by 2020. We will isolate and use five different enzymes to synthesize metallic nanoparticles, reveal the kinetics and mechanism of reactions, and characterize the products by using “beyond-state-of-the-art” instrumental methods (such as GEMMA, PDMA and MALDI-TOF-MS/MS). Implementation of this project will help establishing new interdisciplinary research group targeting problems in the fields of nanotechnology, material science and bio/analytical chemistry, as well as enhance the independent research leadership of the principal investigator by installing the scientific infrastructure necessary for research on the synthesis and targeted application of metal nanoparticles. By deposition of targeted nanoparticles on polymers, we will create new materials foreseen as food packaging materials and geotextiles. This will support the development of the Croatia’s food and textile industries. Moreover, the project will initiate interdisciplinary research with the transfer of knowledge among research groups, as well as provide the opportunity to transfer knowledge to postdoctoral, doctoral and diploma students working on this project. In addition, this project will strengthen international collaborations with scientists from other European universities, and by this support the integration of the Croatian science within the European research framework. 					 				|	|Chemical engineering|	|nanoparticles, enzymes, polymers, sol-gel process, GEMMA, PDMA, GF-AAS, LC-MS/MS|

As many drugs discovery attempts based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis have not been successful, tau protein has become an increasingly important therapeutic target owing to advances in understanding of its role in AD pathogenesis. In AD, the balance of tau kinase and phosphatase activity is shifted, creating a highly phosphorylated species of tau. This raises the fraction of unbound tau, which is no longer attached to microtubules, allowing for monomeric hyperphosphorylated tau to bind to one another to produce oligomers. Fusion of these oligomeric species leads to the formation of paired helical filaments, the primary constituent of neurofibrillary changes, which have been documented to be an early and pivotal event (so-called „pre-tangle“ stage) in the pathogenesis of AD. Our aims are: 1) to define better the relationship between the early AD biomarkers total and phospho-tau proteins, as well as amyloid ß in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD, MCI (mild cognitive impairment), and control subjects. By using innovative ELISA and modified thioflavin S binding assay on CSF samples, we will also assess the ratio between monomer and oligomer (aggregated) tau species. These new data will be correlated to clinical, neuropsychological, and MRI findings; 2) to test the effect of several known and potentially neuroprotective compounds (donepezil, clorgyline, several flavonoids, PF9601N and ASS234, among others) on tau phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid and nocodazole in SH-SY5Y and P19 cell cultures. Tau epitopes phosphorylated at Thr181, Ser199 and Thr231 residues will be analyzed by ELISA, while p-tau epitopes at Thr202, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404 will be analyzed by Western blot; and 3) to investigate biochemically and immunocytochemically the trans-synaptic spreading of neurofibrillary degeneration and tau mRNA expression after the injection of tau oligomers in the mouse entorhinal cortex. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Alzheimer's disease, cerebrospinal fluid, ELISA, neurofibrillary degeneration, neuroprotective compounds, tau protein, thioflavine S|

This survey will be followed by some public attitude surveys concerning relevant tax issues. The macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidation measures in Croatia, with the emphasis on tax measures, will be analyzed at different government levels as well as the effects of tax structure on the economic growth.

Morphometric investigations will be made on leaves and fruits (carob tree) samples gathered in situ, while the genetic variability will be determined using AFLP analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the leaves. The content of polyphenolic compounds, antioxidant activity in vitro with the use of UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the share of macro and microelements using emission spectrometry (AES) will be determined in the leaves and fruits samples.

The existing knowledge on teachers’ emotions indicates their influential potential on instructional practices, professional and personality development and well-being. By implication, emotions experienced by teachers in classroom settings and in relation to their professional activities, arise as a very important topic of research.

Any wireless device needs an antenna as the interface between the electronic circuits and the free space. Wireless communication modules, sensors and RFID devices are integrated in common objects like clothes, home appliances, toys, consumables, etc. The used antennas must be small and unobtrusive, yet energy efficient. The aim of this project is to investigate new materials and techniques for antenna fabrication including conductive textiles and threads. A textile antenna integrated into clothes must be lightweight, flexible, and comfortable to wear, but still must keep good radiation properties. Textile antennas are very interesting for military personnel on the field as well as for rescue teams. Another important application is healthcare, where wireless sensors in real time monitor the patients' health status and transmit data to the medical personnel. The broadest field of application of wearable antennas is in the entertainment and consumer electronics and mobile communications. Energy harvesting, and with it the associated antennas, can be used in all these fields to increase energy efficiency and enable operation of mobile devices. The aim of this project is to propose new and adapt existing antenna designs for integration into clothing and for new manufacturing techniques like embroidering or weaving. Another aspect to be considered in connection with wearable antennas is their operation in the proximity of human body which is a lossy dielectric. The second aim of this project is to study both theoretically and experimentally the propagation channel on the surface of the human body and off-body communications. The results will allow designing reliable on-body and off-body communication systems. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|antenna, textile antenna, wearable antenna, on-body communications, body-centric communications|

A significant part of this heritage is still not easily or reliably accessible to modern scholarship. Leveraging current European and international achievements and initiatives, our project will solve textual and editorial problems through scholarly collaboration, in that way providing grounds and opportunity for further interpretative insights about the life of the texts. The project will prepare and publish both printed and digital editions; editorial work of team members will be submitted to early collective peer review and discussion. The proposed framework will also serve as a training ground for next generations of textual scholars studying early modern Croatian literature; researchers of all career stages (including undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students) will be offered an opportunity to make their first contributions, also peer-reviewed and carefully attributed. Through these innovative procedures we aim to reinterpret scholarly edition as a fruitful and exciting interpretative undertaking, without which there can be no real understanding of our intellectual history. The main outcome of our project will be 15 scholarly editions published over four years: six texts of Croatian authors in Croatian (Mršić, Primović, Palmotić Dionorić, Divković, the Kajkavian miscellany of Nikola Šafran, M. Zlatarić), an edition of three Croatian woman writers in Italian (G. and S. Bona, M. Gondola Gozze), and eight texts of Croatian authors in Latin (Nikola Modruški, Marulić, Beneša, V.

However, currently used libraries lack diversity in terms of biological and chemical properties, i.e. “chemical space” covered is infinitely small. In the past 15 years, only 15 % of the emerging novel chemical entities have been novel classes of compounds. This limitation significantly hampers development of novel lead compounds needed to tackle new generations of biological targets. The project goal is to expand the chemical space of natural product-like compounds by using multicomponent reactions. This will be achieved by: (a) developing novel non-natural amino acid-, carbohydrate- and enediyne-based building blocks; (b) performing Passerini and Ugi multicomponent reactions to obtain structurally diverse linear and macrocyclic compounds and (c) studying the stereochemistry of multicomponent reactions. Project results, and the knowledge about methodologies, stereochemistry and properties of novel compounds, are highly relevant for the following fields: medicinal chemistry - novel structures to fill the libraries; catalyst development – particularly enediyne-based macrocycles; and biomedical studies – carbohydrate-based compounds can be used as biological probes. Project is aligned with the goals of the Croatian Science Foundation: development of competitive research environment, and creation of new knowledge for the strengthening the Croatian economy. Project results will be the base for the generation of libraries with structurally diverse peptide-like small molecules and macrocyclic compounds, as an answer to the pharmaceutical industry needs: identification of yet undisclosed biological targets and the development of novel lead compounds. Therefore, project contributes to one the key objectives in the European Union: improving the health of EU citizens for generation of wealth and public wellbeing. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|peptidomimetics, multicomponent reactions, macrocycles, non-natural amino acids, carbohydrates, enediyne compounds|

In order to do that we have to study different forms of self-generating mechanisms by which the autonomous mind (AM) is brought about. The autonomous then stays roughly for the mental 'infrastructure' that operates by generating impulses for action, mental and motor, without having to process them in consciousness. We will consider this phenomenon as primary in relation to consciousness that emerges rather late in the chain of mental processing. One of the basic premisses that builds the ground for our investigation is the assumption that mental states are heavily underdetermined by sensory data. To claim this is to enter the dispute with the current mainstream (particularly within the consciousness studies) that sees mental phenomena (specifically consciousness) firmly rooted in sensation, on the ne hand; it also means a conflict with the canon of intellectualism, the long-lasting impact of which (following Descartes) resulted in consciousness- and thought-centeredness with which we are faced and which we want to critically examine, on the other hand. Representative of unconscious behavior is automaticity. Yet, whilst many authors affiliate this sort of action primarily with motor habits, we aim to extend the term far beyond bodily behavior and to include complex mental processes such as perception, memory, action, learning, and thought. 					 				|	|Philosophy|	|intellectualism (a critique of), embodiment, autonomous mind, background, unconscious participation, skill, automaticity,|

Meanwhile, researchers also acknowledge the complexity of these processes. Empirical research on the destination brand concept has, however, so far been rather scarce and fragmented. Moreover, comprehensive and systematical research of destination brand equity, encompassing the individual determinants-antecedents and outcomes-consequences, are almost completely lacking. Although a number of researchers have proposed models for measuring brand equity in tourism, these contributions were mainly limited to the hotel industry, while brand-equity building in the context of destinations is rather neglected. Accordingly, developing a comprehensive model of destination brand equity, which integrates both important antecedents and consequences, is one important research gap this project aims to address and fill. Moreover, while several antecedents of destination brand equity have been studied in particular detail, like e.g. brand awareness, brand image, destination quality/attractiveness, or most recently place attachment, very few studies have, in fact, tried to establish a connection between branding practices of destination management organizations and the aimed, as well as the truly achieved, outcomes of these practices. Accordingly, as the first of its kind, the proposed project aims to shed light on the relationship between the destination branding process, on the one hand, and the outcome of this process in terms of brand performance levels, on the other hand. Insight into this relationship should help to establish best or, at least, better practice guidelines for the branding of tourism destinations. 					 				|	|Economy|	|tourism, destination, marketing management, brand equity, brand buidling process, model|

The research would begin with the May Declaration of 1917, which prompted political movement on previously “idle” political scene, and would end with final retreat of Italian military forces from the third occupation zone in 1923 in Dalmatia. Special focus will be devoted to the situation in Dalmatia, and complementary analysis will handle with the situation in other parts of the Eastern Adriatic. Project objectives: 1. Analyze complex set of causes that led to the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy and their influence on public opinion in Eastern Adriatic region, especially in Dalmatia (1917-1918) 2. Explore the influence of external, international, factors on political and social processes in Dalmatia during the observed period, within the context of unidentified national borders and conflict situations. 3. Study the narrative changes in final processes of national integrations (of Dalmatian Croats, Serbs, and Italians, and Slovenes from Trieste) in connection to new political and social environment. 4. Investigate how the “old” elites transformed and adapted to new social environment. 5. Explain formation and activities of new political organizations after 1918 and their influence on Dalmatian society. This topic has not yet been fully explored. One of the biggest research issues are simultaneous and parallel activities of various different institutions in Dalmatia and other Eastern Adriatic regions between 1918 and 1923, particularly during the first period, prior to the Treaty of Rapallo. 					 				|	|History|	|Eastern Adriatic, Dalmatia, Habsburg Monarchy, World War One, Elites|

Despite the fact that violence -related mortality is profoundly undercounted, violent conflict represents the third most important source of mortality around the world. Analyzing the effects that war had on health through the deep time perspective that archaeological investigations afford can provide unique data on the interactions between warfare, health and the environment and provided conclusions that are particularly relevant to disadvantaged communities throughout the developing world where most wars are currently being fought. This project assembles an international and multidisciplinary team of collaborators to conduct bioarchaeological investigations on two large composite skeletal samples from Croatia. The two composite series represent individuals who inhabited Croatia throughout: a) the Late Medieval period (1100-1400 AD) a period of relative prosperity and peace prior to the arrival of Ottoman Turks, and b) individuals who inhabited Croatia in the Historic period (1400-1700 AD) during which time the Ottoman Empire gradually expanded into East and Central Europe. The research will reconstruct Historic period health, diet, weaning practices, and disease and trauma patterns by comparing them with data from the Late Medieval period using bioarchaeological, paleopathological and stable isotope analyses of human burials from Croatia. The project is a collaboration between researchers and postgraduate students who specialize in bioarchaeology, paleopathology, paleodemography, paleodontology, radiology and stable isotope analyses from four institutions: the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the School of Dental Medicine of the University of Zagreb, the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the University Hospital Dubrava, and the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research of the University of Cambridge. 					 				|	|Ethnology and anthropology|	|physical anthropology, bioarchaeology, paleopathology, health, war, osteological analyses, medieval period, Croatia|

The significance of the thorough analysis of corpus in question lies in the dynamics of the crucial moments that determined the outline of the16th century Croatian literary language. That particular period, between the collapsed medieval system of ‘triple articulation’ literary language (depending on the text functions) and the established diglossia (Ferguson 1959, Corin 1993), but before the development of the firm language policy in Post-Tridentine Early Modern Age Europe which signified the beginning of the so-called proto-standardisation era of the Croatian language, is very important in the attempt to promote the uniform language of printed Glagolitic texts. The previous noteworthy attempts to describe the corpus language (17 editions in three scripts, c. 2000 folios in Glagolitic only) were executed using either the obsolete methodology (F. Fancev, 1916) or the smaller sample (Damjanović 2010, 2011; Čupković 2010, 2013). In the past ten years, the new methodology has provided a strong groundwork for full description of that division of language history; reprints were published, the most important of which is The New Testament (1562, 1563) in Latin transliteration (2013); a comprehensive comparative analysis of Kožičić’s Misal hruacki (1531) and the three previously printed Croato-Glagolitic missals were conducted. The project’s objective is the publishing of transliterations and other selected Glagolitic editions from Urach in comparison with parallel Cyrillic and Latin editions, as well as conducting analysis at all language levels. The new methodology abandons the diachronic perspective domination and is directed towards a synchronic approach in combining the language elements of all three Croatian dialects as well as those of the Church Slavonic language. 					 				|	|Philology|	|history of croatian language, glagolitic alphabet, cyrillic alphabet, latin alphabet, literature of croatian protestants|

The starting point of the study is the Ottoman occupation of Bosnia in 1463 confirmed by defeat of Croatian army in the Battle of Krbava in 1493. The main allies of anti-Ottoman resistance Habsburgs, Venice and the popes sought to prevent the Ottoman penetration to the Adriatic and in the West. In their long term efforts they used tools of military revolution that has prevailed on their side. However, the early modern alliance is marked by a profound Habsburg-Venetian rivalry on the Adriatic which was ended by the fall of Venice in 1797 year. A new contender at the Adriatic, the revolutionary France, sought to repel Russians and Britons, and to provide a springboard to the East. After the fall of Napoleon, Austria secured supremacy on the sea, but the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Italy continued the centuries-long conflict over the Adriatic.

Its digestive property has been shown important in different pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and pathogen removal. Discoveries of specific autophagy receptors have opened a new chapter in the autophagy field. Of great interest is the removal of damaged or excess mitochondria through specialized autophagy- mitophagy. Together with colleagues, I have identified and characterized mitochondrial proteins Nix/Bnip3L and Bnip3 as a mitophagy receptors for recruiting the autophagic machinery to damaged mitochondria and help their elimination (Novak et al, 2010; Zhu et al, 2013). We demonstrated that receptors mediate mitochondrial clearance during reticulocyte differentiation. Our goal is to further study autophagy receptors and proteins associated with mitochondrial clearance to better understand the role of mitophagy and its mechanism. We will study: (1) phosphorylation and dimerization of receptors and the consequences of this events on mitophagy progression; (2)factors that regulate tight connection of apoptosis and mitophagy; (3)potential interplay between mitophagy receptors and other mitophagy-related proteins, like E3-ligase Parkin and kinase PINK1; (4)the effects of mitophagy on cancer development. To reach our goals we will use established methodology in our laboratories including protein identification and interaction techniques (Western blot, IP, GST-pull down, RNAi), immunofluorescent microscopy, mass spectrometry, ITC and NMR. All experiments will be performed using cultured cells. This project proposal has a high capacity to generate very interesting data with high possibility for publications in top scientific journals. Fundamentally, generated data will help to understand the physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cancer and allow us to manipulate mitophagy to fight diseases. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|autophagy, mitochondria, mitophagy, receptor, neurodegeneration, cancer|

Respective welfare value of these forests amount to 6,4 billion €, 2,8 billion € being attributed exclusively to ash forests. Growing stock in narrow-leafed ash forests reaches 4,3 million m3, binding 11,8 million tons of carbon dioxide acting as an important carbon sink depository. Natural and artificial regeneration of ash stands is under direct impact of numerous biotic and abiotic factors, many of which seriously hamper the viability of ash. Insect pests, pathogenic fungi, large game ungulates and ruminantes and small rodent populations play dominant role in the complex processes of tree decline and stand deterioration. Additionally, in the course of recent Europe-wide dramatic spread of newly identified lethal disease on ashes (Chalara fraxinea), introduction of a highly damaging Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) on the eastern borders of Europe, and increased frequency of climatic extremes urge the need to intensify the research of this phenomena. Through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, in the course of 4 years, the proposed research project targets on several critical aspects of aforementioned biotic detrimental factors analyzing them in the given area and time and aiming to provide a multitude of new details on the mechanisms of their impact. Modern methodological approach covers the following major research topics: presence, local impact and ash disease spread and host resistance tests; additive impact of ash defoliators in the course of recent decline and possibility to manage their populations via entomopathogenic organisms; the impact of small rodents on tree regeneration, acting also as an important human diseases reservoir; negative impact of large game in ash regeneration; geospatial and temporal analysis of major biotic influences in given forest communities. 					 				|	|Forestry|	|Fraxinus angustifolia, vitality, biotic agents, floodplain forests, modelling|

Namely, BCS offer direct assessment of the otherwise intangible factors such as economic agents’ perceptions and expectations. They measure the agents’ willingness to consume/invest/save, as opposed to their ability to do the same. Hence these psychological factors are crucial to understand the underlying market forces and agents’ behavior. The project goals are to: - Discern whether the non-rationality of consumers’ inflation expectations stems from the true inability of consumers to anticipate price changes, or did the researchers induce it themselves by falsely assuming that the distribution of BCS responses is normal. - Question whether the poor forecasting accuracy of BCS leading indicators can be improved through obtaining the optimal weights by (non)linear optimization. - Compose an optimism indicator based on BCS responses and determine the nature of its relationship with the stock market returns. Nonlinear time series analysis will be employed to test if the stock market reacts asymmetrically to positive/negative shocks in the economic sentiment. - Estimate the consumers’ willingness to buy realty and econometrically model its relationship with actual real estate prices. - Assess the value of BCS responses on households’ financial distress by correlating them to the common measures of poverty. - Employ the BCS data on managers’ perceptions to construct a liquidity indicator for the Croatian economy. The first 5 goals will be fulfilled by analyzing the proposed issues in EU countries, which will improve the general understanding of the role of sentiment in economic decision-making. Each of the stated research fields is expected to result in the publication of a paper in a reputable international journal. The results empirically obtained for Croatia will be synthesized in a scientific book at the end of the project. 					 				|	|Economy|	|Business and Consumer Surveys, economic sentiment, leading indicators, behavioral economics, nonlinear econometrics|

The highest incidence of cancer is in men over 50 years of age. Significantly increased risk of developing OSCC is among smokers and people who daily consume alcohol. OSCC is an aggressive cancer that metastasizes (about 50% of patients have at diagnosis lymph node metastases) thus the successful diagnosis is of major importance for effective therapy. Despite the development of new therapeutics in the treatment of OSCC, no significant increase in five-year survival has been recorded in the past decade. Standard algorithms of treatment include surgical dissection with radiotherapy, while chemotherapy is rarely applied. The latest research suggests that in OSCC is of great importance the evaluation of tumor stroma activation, as it may contain cells that produce signaling molecules crucial for the development of metastases. The aim of this project is to obtain insight into activated cells in the stroma of OSCC in relation to patient survival. The study will be based on archived tissues, and will involve assessing the level of receptor on malignant cells and stromal tumors (androgens, estrogens), metaloproteinase 9, cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia factors and factors Ki67 proliferation. The expected result will contribute to histological diagnostics and enable individual approach of OSCC therapy. Through questionnaires will be examined the lifestyle habits of patients, exposures, family history and their possible impact on the OSCC histological profile. Within the project a website will be developed which will contain results of the project, the base of current research projects, clinical studies, relevant publications and a forum. The website will contribute to better cooperation between clinicians and other interested experts, and bring benefit for patients as well as future international recognition 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|oral cancer, estrogen, androgen, cytokines, stroma|

Observable pathology is mostly absent, and the cause is unknown. Psychological and mechanical stress factors could contribute to oxidative stress (OS) and lead to TMD. Aims are to quantify salivary OS markers and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and to quantify recently isolated endogenous peptide opiorphin (OP) in saliva of TMD patients and compare them to controls. As chronic exposure to stress may cause hyperalgesia as a result of the stress response in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, aim is to test this as an underlying mechanism by correlating OP and OS markers to salivary cortisol (SC) levels. Hypotheses: OS has a role in TMD onset and maintenance, thus salivary markers of OS will increase and/or TAC will decrease; OP influences orofacial pain syndromes, such as TMD, and its salivary level will differ between TMD patients and controls. Disbalanced HPA axis underlies the increase of OS and OP level changes in TMD patients. Saliva of 50 TMD patients (diagnosed by validated diagnostic criteria and MRI) and 50 controls will be collected. OS markers will be assessed by ELISA with spectrophotometric detection and by spectrophotometric reagent kits. OP levels will be measured by HPLC-MS/MS method, developed by team members. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ECLIA will be used for measuring SC. TMD patients will be randomized in 2 treatment groups (1:stabilization splint + placebo pills; 2:placebo splint + 1g of vitamin C). Measurements will be repeated after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Monitoring of OP, OS markers and SC during that period will, in relation to TMD symptoms changes, further elucidate underlying proposed mechanism. Novel approach to understanding neuroendocrine mechanisms in TMD and use of saliva as non-invasively available biofluid represent significant advances. 					 				|	|Dental medicine|	|temporomandibular disorders, oxidative stress, opiorphin, orofacial pain, ELISA, HPLC MS, saliva|

Main hypothesis of our research is that strong activation of immune and inflammatory responses is result of increased levels of extracellular Hsp70 (eHsp70) in COPD patients. The objective of in vitro investigations is to explore underlying mechanisms of eHsp70 effects in pulmonary and peripheral blood cells. Therefore we will monitor activation of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, NLRP3 inflammasome, and signalling molecules MAPKs and NF-kappaB, important for pro-inflammatory cytokines release (TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta). To elucidate the functional significance of molecules’ activation in eHsp70-induced inflammation, we will use specific agonists, antagonists and inhibitors. We will also explore eHsp70 cytotoxicity and differentiate between various modes of cell death (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis). The objective of ex vivo investigations is to associate eHsp70 and other pro-inflammatory parameters with clinically relevant COPD outcomes. The proposed study provides longitudinal investigations of systemic inflammatory biomarkers in stabile COPD patients, and smoking and non-smoking controls. Spirometry measurements will be performed annually during three year follow up, and blood will be collected at the recruitment and after one year. Genetic component of the disease will be explored by assessing expression (RT-qPCR) and polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) of Hsp70, TLR2 and TLR4 genes. Systemic inflammation will be evaluated by pro-inflammatory DAMPs (eHsp70, eATP, IL-1alpha), cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-1beta) and general biomarkers (leukocytes, CRP, fibrinogen) determination. We believe that obtained results will provide new information on the systemic inflammatory COPD phenotype, which might help to individualize therapeutic strategy, and to improve relevant clinical outcomes of the disease. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Hsp70, COPD, inflammation, TLR, NLRP3 inflammasome, signalling molecules, cell death, biomarkers|

This issue became important after a decade of economic growth driven through domestic demand fuelled by huge flows of capital to many european pheriphery. These capital flows fed huge housing bubbles and created booms in the countries receiving the inflows. The booms caused the rise of costs and prices much more in the periphery than in the core. Peripheral economies became increasingly uncompetitive, which was a problem once the capital inflows stopped. The result was slumps in the periphery, which lost a lot of internal demand but remained weak on the external side thanks to the loss of competitiveness. The problem was greatly exacerbated when the combination of slumping revenues and the prospect of protracted economic weakness led to large budget deficits. There was panic in the bond market and the EU core demanded harsh austerity programs. Austerity led to much deeper slumps in the periphery and without expansion in the core, the result was in fact a slump for the EU economy as a whole. Labor market rigidities, weak business environment and structure of domestic production make competition recovery sluggish (Felipe, Kumar, 2011). Labor and product market reforms increase the mobility of production factors improving their allocation in the economy. Financial market reforms boost competiveness as a consequence of higher competition and further integration in EU. The main goal of the project is to show that reforms in these areas are needed to facilitate wage adjustment and improve the business environment (Orszaghova et. al, 2013). The project takes into account that external competitiveness can be explained as an expression of high ?rm-level productivity. Projects goals will be achieved through implementation of appropriate econometrics techniques. This project can help to improve external competitiveness and overall economic activity in EU countries. 					 				|	|Economy|	|economic policy, structural reforms, external competitiveness, current account, export, price competiveness, non-price competiveness, product market,|

Denys Neville WHEATLEY, |	|In the proposed research project we aim to determine the involvement of Dishevelled and TCF/LEF families of human genes in the process of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in brain tumors. We believe that the changes of structure and expression of the selected genes correlate with the phenotypic changes of tumor cells. EMT is a process very much involved in invasion and progression of tumors. Many oncogenic signaling pathways can induce EMT. The classical Wnt pathway has a particularly tight link with EMT and it has been shown that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin can induce EMT. Wnt pathway is one of the basic cellular pathways whose misregulation plays important roles in tumorigenesis and whose mediators of transcription are members of TCF/LEF family. Another important protein family is the Dishevelled considered to be the central hub of Wnt signaling since it interacts with Wnt receptors and recruits the multiprotein beta-catenin destruction complex. The experiments of the proposed research will use modern methods of molecular biology for the analyses of brain tumor samples of different malignancy grades. The genetic changes will be tracked by PCR/loss of heterozygosity, heteroduplex and Spreadex electorphoresis (Elchrom Scientific, Switzerland) methods. Expression of selected proteins will be studied by immunohistochemistry demonstrating their location in tumor cells. Besides its scientific value, results from the proposed project will have an application in medical diagnostics. Identifying changes in molecules responsible for control of cell motility will give us the preconditions for understanding the invasiveness of brain tumors and offer new disease progression markers. Our experimental evidence would also encourage the development of therapies that specifically interfere with Wnt signaling in cancer. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|Wnt signaling, EMT, brain tumors, invasion, dishevelled, TCF/LEF|

The aquatic ecosystem responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economic forcing induced by global climate changes, including warming, acidification, biodiversity modifications as well changes in frequency of extreme events (flooding, dust input, hypoxia-anoxia appearance) and by growing anthropogenic pressures will be considered under SPHERE. Effects of the main natural and anthropogenic forcing (extreme events, eutrophication, global changes) related with S and C dynamics will be studied. The SPHERE objectives are: 1) testing and improving existing methods and development of new methods essential for S and organic matter (OM) characterization in water and atmospheric environment; 2) to estimate exchanges and interactions of S and C with other natural and potentially toxic trace elements within and between the major environmental compartments; 3) to monitor and couple S and C dynamics under extreme events (stratification-destratification, hypoxia-anoxia, extreme atmospheric inputs); 4) to synthesize all obtained data for assessment of ecosystem vulnerability and ecological status, in line with water framework directive and national strategy. The SPHERE will be implemented in the period of 4 years through 5 workpackages: 1) OM properties and dynamics; 2) S speciation and dynamic; 3) S, C interaction with trace metals and importance of chalcogenide nanoparticles; 4) thermodynamic predictions for S and C distribution and dynamics; 5) project management. 					 				|	|Chemistry|	|sulphur speciation, organic matter properties, nanoparticles in water environment, aerosols, global climate changes, extreme events, euxinia|

Natural native habitats for this endangered European plant (according to the IUCN Red list of threatened plant species) are relatively untouched forest with significant nearby water. The genetic similarity between wild and cultivated grapes is very high (including sexual compatibility) although the wild grape has not passed through the strict selection process of domestication. Thus, there are possible unique traits and alleles still present in the wild grape genome, which should be explored and used in modern grapevine breeding.

Theoretical and other, non-lexicographical, applied linguistic research include those within the fields of: semantics (esp. of the lexis expressing feelings/passions), theory and practice of (medieval) translation (direct translation from Latin into CCS, and inherited OCS translations of the Greek texts within the CCS tradition), grammar (primarily syntax of negation, agreement, infinitive, CCS psalter), textology (selected CCS texts, CCS psalter). Substantial contribution of the project research cover (inter)national fields of: (paleo)slavistic and medieval studies, historical lexicography, diachronic study of the Croatian language diasystem, interdisciplinary investigation of the history of emotions. Finally, through the CCS corpus management (i.e. conversion of the CCS corpus into digitally readable format) and the DCRCS compiling, the project offers irreplaceable and permanent assistance to any scholarly or scientific field interested in the CCS texts contents.

Owing to growing evidence of brain insulin resistance (BIR) and cerebral metabolic dysfunction being the mediators of sporadic AD (sAD), restoring of brain insulin signalling and downstream defects has recently become a new target in AD treatment research. Unique contribution of this proposal is in characterization of the therapeutic potential of oral galactose in animal models which mimic sAD and familial AD. The former is generated by streptozotocin-intracerebroventricular application (STZ-icv rat) which induces BIR and eventually develops many of sAD-like features, and the latter is transgenic Tg2576 mice which eventually show some signs of BIR. Galactose is alternative source of energy; it enters the cell via insulin-independent glucose transporter GLUT3 and is metabolized to glucose. PI’s recent publication indicates that oral galactose prevents development of cognitive deficits in STZ-icv rat model. This research will explore if it can prevent them in Tg2576 mice and ameliorate already developed cognitive deficits in both Tg2576 mice and STZ-icv rats. Innovative aspect of the proposal is elucidation of oral galactose-mediated improvement in cerebral glucose uptake and stimulation of glucagone-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, and their correlation to cognitive improvement in both models. Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance tests, radio-tracing of brain glucose metabolism, Western blot analysis, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays and immunohistochemistry will be used to detect effects of 2-month oral galactose treatment on memory loss, GLUT3/GLUT4 and insulin degrading enzyme levels, tau and amyloid-ß pathology in the brain, and galactose, insulin and GLP-1 levels in blood/cerebrospinal fluid. Project results will gain new knowledge and provide significant insights into a novel nutrient-related therapeutic strategy in AD treatment. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|oral galactose, streptozotocin, transgenic Tg2576 mice, Alzheimer's disease, glucagone-like peptide-1|

Tomato transplants and hydroponically grown tomatoes will be infested by whitefly populations maintained at IAC. Besides the main experimental task, the whitefly population densities assessment at different development stages, the effect of grafting on tomato vegetative and reproductive growth and development, physiological parameters and fruit quality will be studied.

Whereas a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity still remains elusive, some of the assessed properties revealing a nonlocal character of such a theory (i. e. noncommutativity of spacetime coordinates, UV/IR mixing and the holographic principle) has already changed our perspective upon reconciliation of the quantum field theory (QFT) framework with general relativity. A particular attention will be paid to construction, classification and unification of NC spaces. In this regard, a procedure can be defined by making use of rigorous quantum deformation techniques as well as some well known differential algebra concepts and also the Hopf algebra methods. This permits formulation and study of the twist-deformed Riemannian geometry, the twisted version of Einstein's equations and the algebraic structure on kappa-deformed Minkowski space. A further extension of these ideas opens a possibility to study NC effect in black holes. Furthermore, using the tools of QFT in curved spacetime, several aspects of modern cosmology will be covered including those based on the most successful realization of the holographic principle - the AdS/CFT duality. Finally, a class of quantum gravity models will be tested by probing Lorentz violation in observations of rapidly-varying astrophysical sources of high-energy gamma-rays.

However, in the past few decades they are increasingly under the influence of integration processes at the supra-national, regional and international level. The emergence of economic and political unions and globalisation processes exert as a by-product pressure to harmonise or even unify the way in which national civil justice systems operate. In an attempt to create a ‘genuine area of justice’, new unified procedures are being developed. They operate in parallel with national civil procedures, and sometimes even strive to replace them. As a reaction to the forces that endeavour to harmonise and unify procedural laws and practices, an opposite trend is gaining momentum: a trend that insists on diversity and pluralism of national civil procedures. The basis of this trend is the claim for national procedural autonomy/sovereignty. The research within this project will focus on the evolution of procedural reforms in various jurisdictions, with a particular emphasis on Croatia, its broader region (successor states of the former Yugoslavia) and Europe. The purpose is to identify to what extent the tensions between the centrifugal and centripetal forces contribute to development of judicial structures that provide a higher level of proper and effective legal protection, and to which extent these tensions create confusion and produce legal transplants and irritants that are equally or less effective than traditional procedures. 					 				|	|Law|	|civil justice, civil procedure, harmonisation, unification, globalization, integration, ius commune, effective legal protection, legal history|

Adopting a broad perspective it will take into account most diverse aspects of identity, such as social, political, religious, ethnic, or individual, as well as their interactions. This requires investigation of diverse historical sources which range from texts (e.g. historiography, diplomatic correspondence, notary records), to social practices (e.g. ritual) or urban topography and visual arts. Besides such comprehensiveness, another important novelty of the project is its chronological scope. It takes into account long period of almost half a millennium, thereby disregarding the conventional divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, which will enable valuable insights into long term (dis)continuities. Yet another important novelty is that the project focuses on a premodern city-state, a type of community relatively neglected in the field of identity studies mostly focused on modern period and national states. Finally, the project will also adopt a strongly comparative perspective, investigating the (dis)similarities between Dubrovnik and other Mediterranean cities. Since the enterprise of this scope necessarily involves specialists in different fields and methodologies, the project assembles an interdisciplinary team led by the Academician Nenad Vekarić. It consists of ten scientists, two postdoctoral researchers and four doctoral students. The project proposes to publish more than 10 scientific books, numerous articles, and organize four workshops. Besides offering the answer to an important scientific problem, the main objective of the project is to present to the international audiences the less known but important case of Dubrovnik, thus contributing to the visibility and networks of Croatian scholars. 					 				|	|History|	|Dubrovnik, Identity, Middle Ages, Early Modern Period, cultural history|

Vlakno cave is currently the only site in northern Dalmatia available for studying Palaeolithic/Mesolithic transition, continuity and discontinuity of settlement, Palaeolithic and Mesolithic culture, territorial organization, etc. Over the past 10 years research activities were incorporated in different scientific projects, but our primary objective is to get further insights into the way of life of prehistoric communities. Combination of field work, cabinet studies and analyses will be used to determine interaction of cave with environment in order to obtain data comparable with other sites on the Adriatic coast. New research of Vlakno cave will contribute new data to the study of the European Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic from a relatively understudied area. Also Vlakno cave could set a theoretical model of Paleolithic-Mesolithic transition, applicable to a wider area. The proposed project should significantly enrich the knowledge on the culture of living and social relations of Palaeolithic/Mesolithic communities. It will help define the ways in which humans modified their behaviour in response to global warming and sea-level rise and propose stronger theoretical and empirical model of transition to different climatic and environmental conditions of Holocene. Project will also provide important information on Adriatic human settlement and migration patterns during this climatically unstable period. 					 				|	|Archeology|	|Vlakno, Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Epigravettian, Holocene|

The link between the two is poorly understood. There is growing evidence that OSAS contributes to the initiation and progression of hypertension, heart failure, cardiac ischemia, stroke and cognitive decline. Chronic sympathetic activation resulting in elevated sympathetic nerve activity and cardio-respiratory sensitivity to hypoxia appears to be important. Still, the exact mechanisms underlying the link between OSA and cardiovascular and neurophysiologic disturbances are not completely known. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) in experimental animals can mimic periods of repeated apneas seen in OSAS patients. Exposure to repeated bouts of hypoxia in human leads to increased sympathetic activity, whilst intermittent hypoxia in experimental animals evokes increases in phrenic and sympathetic nerve activities. The proposed study will examine the role of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (e.g. serotonin and opioids) in evoking sympathetic long-term facilitation using anesthetized animal model of IH. The only way to understand complex pathophysiological interactions in OSAS patients is to use translational and multidisciplinary approach, as proposed in this project. Our focus in the human studies is to study neurophysiologic (brain motor control, control of breathing, neurographic features of peripheral nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity) function in OSAS patients and the links to metabolic, stress, and cognitive parameters. Preliminary data from pilot studies suggest it is possible to achieve the new findings using this novel approach. We will also study longitudinal therapeutic effects of the gold standard therapy in OSAS such as the overnight use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices in Split Sleep Cohort of patients, which we plan to form during the work on this project. 					 				|	|Clinical sciences|	|intermittent hypoxia, phrenic long term facilitation, respiratory neuroplasticity, sleep apnea, neurophysiology, polysomnography|

The primary issue addressed in the field of HTSC is the existence of electron pockets in low magnetic fields caused by charge density waves, CDW, in pure YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals. We propose to measure the magnetisation and specific heat in the whole doping range to extract the total density of states at the Fermi level and thereby determine the number of pockets. At the same time we will look for thermodynamic signatures of the CDW phase transitions. Other unresolved controversies which will be investigated include the doping evolution of the mean-field upper critical field and whether Gaussian superconducting fluctuations can account for the magnetisation and specific heat of both underdoped and overdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals at T&gt;Tc. In the field of TI, we will investigate the thermoelectric properties of bismuth based chalcogenide (BiSbTeSe2) and 3D Dirac semimetals and to find the evidence of the linear dispersion and nontrivial topology of these materials. Our next aim is to achieve ferromagnetism in selected TIs; TlBi(S0.5Se0.5)2, PbSnTe and PbSnSe by doping with Mn or Fe and gain understanding of the mechanism responsible for the ferromagnetic ordering. In the field of MG and NCA the goal is to gain some insight into the glassy structure and mechanism involved in its crystallisation. In the field of organic conductors we intend to investigate PANI-DBSA (DBSA-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid) thin film samples. A particular emphasis of the research will be the further development of novel apparatus to measure the magnetisation and specific heat of small single crystals which are often of the highest quality. 					 				|	|Physics|	|Superconductivity, topological insulators, metallic glasses, nanocrystalline alloys, conducting polymers,|

Numerous studies, including those from our laboratory have established that the injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is the important site for pathophysiologic changes that lead to development of neuropathic pain. Although DRG neurons are critical for the onset of neuropathic pain, there are no relevant clinical treatments for neuropathic pain that target this organ. With this proposal we aim to prove that neurostimulation techniques can be successfully used to manipulate neuronal function at the level of experimentally injured DRGs. In order to test this hypothesis we will construct a fully implantable neuronal stimulator for freely moving rats, devise an implantation technique and define stimulation protocols. This stimulator will be tested in rats with two types of experimentally induced nerve injury; spinal nerve ligation and carrageenan-induced inflammation model. Since this invasive procedure bears substantial risk of inflammation and other adverse neural tissue response, which can induce pain per se, we will also investigate connective tissue fibrosis and neuroinflammatory response in neural tissue of DRG and dorsal horn. The effect of the stimulation on excitability of injured DRG neurons will also be tested in vitro. Our last aim builds on our previous study in which we showed that neuronal injury may disable T-junction filtering and thereby increase the net conduction of afferent traffic. With this proposal we will test whether stimulation can modulate filtering properties of DRG T-junction. This will be addressed using recordings from injured sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia excised from adult rats, and recently developed methodology that will allow us to electrically visualize action potential propagation in DRG neurons grown over custom microelectrode arrays. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|neuropathic pain, nerve injury, neuromodulation, dorsal root ganglion, ganglionic field stimulation, T-junction, microelectrode arrays|

Its unique hydration structure enables it to interact with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules which probably contribute to the multifunctional character of trehalose. The major applications of trehalose have been in science, medicine and cosmetic sectors due to its natural functionality, mechanism of action and technical qualities. The limiting factor of trehalose use in the food industry used to be the ingredient cost but with development of a new manufacturing process, the cost of trehalose production has been dramatically reduced. It is about 45% as sweet as sucrose and very stable under processing and storage conditions. Texture, colour and aroma are the main quality attributes influencing consumer acceptability of fruit products. During formulation of fruit products different additives are often used to obtain desired properties of semi-products or final products. The aim of this project is investigation of the influence of trehalose on fruit product quality with emphasis on the explanation of trehalose mechanism of action in complex fruit product matrices. Practical application of project results would be valuable for new food product development. Through addition of trehalose to fruit product the retention of key aroma compounds, and prevention of colour degradation could be achieved, ensuring in this way more fresh-like characteristics of the final product. Also, through retention of phenols, especially pigments, such as anthocyanins, which are known for their antioxidant properties, obtained products would have higher nutritional value, as well as organoleptic properties. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|trehalose, fruit products, colour, aroma, texture, trehalose action|

The materials' parameters in existing US systems used in biomedicine and industry are determined at low excitation levels assuming linear physical principles and consistent thermodynamical conditions. This is different from real operating conditions where range of applied powers and types of excitation signals is various and very often far away from linear. The neglect of these nonlinearities in active and passive materials, used in the complete US system construction process, leads to the problem of the US systems’ efficiency factor in the nonlinear driving conditions. The construction of modular measurement system with included and modified interferometry and time of flight principle with added new measurement procedure is crucial for developing novel US systems with higher electroacoustic efficiency factors. The new method is based on tracking the resonant frequency changes of the nonlinear electro-mechanical-acoustical system for determination complex material parameters. The new modular measurement system will enable exposure of materials to the US fields with various driving conditions. Tracking the resonant frequency changes of excitated loading medium sample (active piezoceramic or passive construction elements or different types of loading mediums) is novel method for determination of material parameters when nonlinear effects appear in the loading mediums. As a result of more precise constructive material parameters determination, three prototypes of US systems with probes and electronic excitation circuits for applications in biomedicine and industry, with obtained higher electroacoustic efficiency factors will be developed, constructed and tested during this project. 					 				|	|Electrical engineering|	|material parameters, ultrasound, modular measurement system, nonlinear effects, effciency factor|

Adenovirus type 26 (AdV26) has fundamental differences in immunogenicity from other AdV vectors, which might give it advantage over other AdV serotypes in vaccine vector development. To the best of our knowledge there are no reports describing AdV26 entry pathway underlining the need for studying infection pathway used by AdV26. Accordingly, the main objectives of this study are investigating AdV26 receptor usage, binding, internalization, intracellular trafficking and AdV26 mediated induction of innate immune response. Our scientific objectives are novel, innovative and designed to generate new knowledge and opportunities for therapeutic advances in areas of unmet clinical need. Our technical objectives use state-of-the-art, span academic and industrial specialties creating cross sector knowledge and long lasting inter-sectoral benefits. With this project we will introduce new line of AdV vector research in our group that would position us on the exciting and cutting edge of AdV research.

LBT refers to how easily and to what extent citizens can access information on local government revenues and expenditures. Transparent budgets are a first step toward democratizing the budget process and giving citizens a say in policy formulation and resource allocation. A non-transparent budget cannot be properly analysed, its implementation cannot be thoroughly monitored nor can its outcomes be evaluated. Despite the importance of LBT, research into its measures, causes and consequences is thin. Our aim is to fill this literature gap and investigate: LBT in Croatia and Slovenia, how it changes over time and why some local budgets are more transparent than others. We will also try to answer: whether LBT affects budget outcomes in election years; whether it affects election outcomes and whether its changes over time influence incumbents' and voters’ preferences regarding budget outcomes. Building upon the existing literature and our previous works, the aim is to construct the basis for future research into LBT, resulting in an open local budget index (OLBI). We will first harmonize and adapt the already existing Croatian methodology (Ott, Bronić and Petrušić, 2013; 2014) so that it can be further continually, annually applied in the same way in Croatia and Slovenia. Since this will be the first time that LBT will be empirically measured and monitored for a fairly long period of time in two countries, and since except for our own work (Ott, Bronić and Petrušić, 2013; 2014) we could find no other papers dealing with the causes and consequences of LBT, our continuous research will represent a unique contribution to the existing literature. Our results will also enable better policy-making and greater citizens’ participation in local budget deliberations. 					 				|	|Economy|	|lokalne jedinice, transparetnost proračuna, Indeks otvorenosti lokalnih proračuna, Hrvatska, Slovenija|

The advantages they provide are tunability of interactions, possibility to control and explore dimensionality effects, disorder and quantum statistics. They allow the experimental realisation and study of both traditional models from condensed matter physics and novel systems such as spin-orbit coupled (SOC) bosons. Especially interesting are their universal properties, which enable establishment of connections between phenomena at different energy and length scales. The resonant regime of zero-scattering length provides a universal strongly interacting unitary limit, where accurate theoretical predictions beyond mean field are necessary. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are able to accurately solve many-body Schrodinger equation of atoms, molecules, liquids, solids and different model systems. In the project we'll further develop the methods and apply them to problems in the field of cold Bose and Fermi atoms, with the goal to characterize their universal properties. First, we'll study few-body systems, focusing on realistic molecular quantum halo states, such as helium-alkali clusters. The goal is to establish whether universal scaling relations between energy and size, already established for trimers, can be established for clusters with more particles. This would provide benchmark for halo states in nuclear physics. Next, the effect of disorder and dimensionality on universal properties of trapped Bose-Bose and Bose-Fermi systems will be studied. Especially interesting is the superfluid-insulator transition and localization of superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation. Finally, QMC methods will be further developed so that spin degree of freedom is explicitly accounted for, which will allow study of universality and novel phases of SOC gases. 					 				|	|Physics|	|ultracold gases, Quantum Monte Carlo, universality, disorder, BEC, superfluid, spin-orbit coupling, quantum halo state|

Typical wines and olive oils will be selected and their typical sensory characteristics and descriptors will be defined by professional certified tasters. A novel quantitative descriptive sensory evaluation form for the assessment of typicity will be created. Typical samples from native and introduced varieties will be subjected to chemical profiling and quantification by headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) for volatile aromas, and high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) for phenolics. Quantitative descriptive sensory evaluation will be performed. The results will be processed by chemometrics. The prototypical monovarietal products will be subjected to in-depth metabolomic and olfactometric analysis to identify previously unidentified compounds, and to determine the hierarchy of volatiles and their relative contribution to typical aroma. Expected results include: determination of typical chemical composition and sensory characteristics of wines and olive oils from native and introduced varieties in Croatia, determination of the physico-chemical basis and drivers of sensory typicity, determination of markers of varietal origin able to discriminate between typical products from native and introduced varieties, determination of unchanging characteristics and indicators that remain determinants of varietal origin despite intra-varietal variability, determination of intra-varietal differences. Factors that highlight and preserve varietal typicity will be identified through a set of field and technological experiments.

Identify potentially detrimental mutations and to estimate detrimental load in all analysed populations; 3.) develop computerised approach (set of algorithms) that will, in terms of probability or likelihood, enable imputation of sequenced mtWGS haplotypes for other pedigree members as well as to point to animals that are wrongly assigned to the pedigree, 4.) Identify mutations that are associated with phenotypic variability of milk production and fertility traits and to estimate the magnitude of the mtWGS effects (haplotypes) in terms of variance components and 5.) Identify private (specific) mutations that can be used in traceability or genetic bar-coding of species and breeds (this is of particular interest for endangered populations). In performing these comprehensive analyses we will use newly developed methodologies of high-throughput sequencing and complex computing analyses. We believe that this research will stimulate other researchers involved in animal genetics and breeding of other species (dog, horse, swine, rabbit, etc…) for similar researches. Furthermore, results of the project will be economically utilised in cattle breeding as well as conservation management of endangered Croatian breeds. At the same time, we hope that innovative and technologically advanced component of this research will result in good publication record for all scientists involved which will further increase our competitiveness to approach to EU funded projects. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|Whole mitogenome, Cattle, Detrimental effects, Phenotypic variability, Quantitative genetics|

Although some of these residues are beginning to be managed to a certain extent, higher benefits should be obtained from these materials. Polyphenols abundant in olive waste have been recognized as compounds of high added value but due to the lack of efficient methods of isolation; significant variations in quality of available extracts and lack of their chemical characterization, the possibilities of further investigation of their health related properties and utilization in the segment of functional foods or dietary supplements is very limited. The major goals of this projects are: 1. to develop sustainable procedure for the extraction of polyphenols from olive waste by using unconventional extraction techniques such as ultratrasound- and microwave assisted extraction, alone or in combination with microencapsulation. That should provide significant advantages over the traditional extractions methods 2. to develop efficient drying procedure for obtaining crude olive pomace extracts (COPE) using contemporary methodological approaches with satisfactory physico-chemical properties, organoleptic characteristics and increased shelf-life. 3. to provide functional characterization of COPE using contemporary methodological approaches (bioavailability and absorption of active compounds from COPE, antioxidant activity in food model systems and biological activity) In addition to providing novel scientific knowledge and serve as the excellent starting point for further scientific investigations of particular biological activities, the results of this project have great potential to be further used by food- and pharmaceutical industry. Also, in broader sense, obtained results will contribute to the meaningful management of olive mill waste resulting with both economical and ecological benefit in the future. 					 				|	|Food technology|	|olive waste, sustainable development, antioxidant, food supplement, bioavailability, polyphenols|

This area exhibits conspicuously lower seismicity than the neighbouring regions to the NW and to the SE. Recorded earthquakes are shallow and weak. The apparent low level of seismic activity here is not readily explainable by the proposed tectonic models of the circum-Adriatic area, according to which this quiescent region is not expected to exist at all! We propose to undertake seismological and tectonic study involving installation of a dense seismograph network whose data should enable accurate location and FPS computation for weak events, receiver function analyses, ambient noise tomography, investigation of attenuation and anisotropy, etc. Together with tectonic survey which will enable construction of geological cross-sections and reconstruction of tectonic evolution and paleo-stress fields we hope to get closer to answering the following questions: - Is the low-seismicity gap that we observe in the Mt. Velebit region a seismic quiescence, or is it a feature related to seismotectonics? Is the seismic hazard underestimated? - Does the Velebit thrust, which is considered as the major seismogenic fault, exist or not? If so, where is it located, what are its geometry and kinematics and is it still active and potential seismogenic source? - Which are seismogenic fault sources in the Mt. Velebit area? - Can we link apparent seismic gap with the deep structures i.e. the missing subduction slab under this area, or is it related to a different kinematic history of this area? - What roles do the lithospheric processes under the Velebit area play in the development of the Dinarides? - Can we improve our knowledge on the Moho-topography? - What does the surface-wave group velocity spatial distribution tell us about the velocity structure? - Do the attenuation or anisotropy properties in the Mt.

Berislav Lisnić, |	|The infection of mice with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as a model of human CMV (HCMV) infection has been particularly informative in elucidating the role of antiviral immune response. NK cells are essential in early control of CMV infection. An evolutionary struggle between NK cells and CMVs can be inferred from a numerous viral mechanisms designed to compromise NK cell function. A deeper insight was gained by studying MCMV evasion of ‘missing-self’ mechanisms and host response to this immunoevasion, illustrated by several MCMV-specific NK cell activating receptors. The work on Ly49H receptor emphasized the selective pressure imposed on the virus to generate variants no longer recognized by this receptor. Another example can be seen from the function of viral m04 protein, which binds to newly synthesized MHC-I molecules and escorts them to the cell surface to engage inhibitory Ly49 receptors. However, while m04 prevents NK cell activation by escaping ‘missing-self’ recognition, several activating Ly49 receptors also depend on its presence for their own recognition of infected cells. Beside m04, another so far unidentified viral factor is required for turning on the activating Ly49 receptors. In addition to characterization of this new viral gene, the aim of this study is to elucidate the functional significance of MCMV-specific activating Ly49 receptors and their interaction with inhibitory counterparts during primary and latent infection. Ly49 receptors in mice are functional homologues of KIR receptors in humans. Recent studies also indicate a strong impact of HCMV on the repertoire and frequency of activating KIR-expressing NK cells, suggesting their specific response to this virus. Therefore, in addition to the MCMV genes involved in ligation of activating Ly49 receptors, here we also propose study aimed to characterize HCMV gene(s) involved in ligation of activating KIRs. We expect these studies to provide new data of groundbreaking potential in the field. 					 				|	|Basic Medical Sciences|	|NK cells, cytomegalovirus, immunoevasion, Ly49 receptors, KIR receptors, transcriptomics|

They congregated in the “Schiavoni/Illyrian” confraternities in Rome, Venice, Recanati, Fano, Loreto and Udine, while institutionalized assistance for students of the same origin attending Italian universities during the Early Modern period was provided by the “national” colleges in Bologna, Loreto and Fermo. The architecture of buildings used by these institutions, as well as paintings and sculpture and other works of art commissioned by their members, played an important role in the construction of the cultural identity of these immigrant communities. The aim of the project is to investigate the construction of intrinsic cultural identities that found their expression in the art and architecture of Schiavoni/Illyrian institutions over the centuries, through the exploration of historical narratives articulated in terms of visual arts. These art-historical phenomena are to be regarded in comparative perspective as well as in context of similar expressions found in “national” institutions of other foreign communities in Italy. In addition to in-depth art-historical analysis of the surviving and/or documented art and architecture of the said national institutions in Italy, special attention will be placed on the dynamics of artistic commissions, along with the issue of confraternity members or college alumni as possible mediators in Croatian patrons’ commissions from Italian artists. This research will provide a new insight on the circulation of taste and knowledge as well as on the impact of different Italian art markets on the art in the South-East Europe, particularly in the present-day Croatia, enriching the understanding of the role of artistic heritage in the construction of proto-national identity in the European context. 					 				|	|Art history|	|Schiavoni/Illyrians, confraternity, college, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Marche, art|

For most people the adolescence is the tipping point for career decision making. Last grade high-school students have to decide between further education on universities or entering the world of work and finding a job. To successfully overcome this important career transition period, adolescents have to become aware of their preferences and capabilities, to crystallize their career goals and to form their vocational identity. By implementing their vocational identity through engagement in their desired job or educational program, they should be able to achieve success and satisfactions in their careers, to fit in and adjust to their working environment and job demands, and to be motivated for their work and future advancement. The Adolescent Career Transition Model encompasses several career related behaviours, competences and traits that can influence positive career transition outcomes. We will assess approximately 1200 high school students at the beginning of the last grade of high-school (17-18 years) and follow their career development for the next 18 months. In three separate time points we will administer measures of career-related traits and social support, career self-guidance competencies, vocational development and career transition outcomes, through a secure online testing system that will be developed for this project. Statistical data analysis of the obtained data will be performed by adequate multivariate models to answer specific research objectives. Once the postulation and evaluation of the ACTM and the dissemination of the results are completed, the aim of the project is to create a new online career guidance system on the basis of the results of our research. This new online guidance system will be open and free for public use, and remain as a valuable and practically usefully legacy of the project. 					 				|	|Psychology|	|career transition, adolescence, career maturity, career identity, career decision making|

The importance of accurate volatility estimates has become even more significant after the financial crisis. As volatility itself is not observable variable, many different volatility estimators have emerged in the literature to address this problem. This project proposal will explore some of methodologically complexities of volatility modelling and forecasting with respect to both the parametric and nonparametric approaches. Moreover, one of the objectives is to investigate news impact curve of different volatility models as well as to compare different types of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedascity models in terms of their ability to describe structural changes in returns and to explore if Markov regime switching GARCH models outperform uni-regime GARCH models in forecasting volatility when sudden switching occurs. According to previous commonly used aspects of volatility measurement and modelling, two relatively new approaches will be explored. First one relies on neural-networks as econometric tool. The second one combines panel methodology with GARCH models. It should be emphasized that new OHLC volatility estimator will be defined as the most efficient one when high frequency data is not available. The main contribution is to train doctoral and postdoctoral students within interdisciplinary areas of statistics, econometrics, financial econometrics, mathematics, operational research and their applications. 					 				|	|Economy|	|OHLC volatility estimator, GARCH switching model, news impact curve, panel-GARCH models, high-frequency data, neural-networks, quasi-Newton algorithm|

This project will investigate a possibility to design and operate a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell with ambient air without external humidification using water and heat produced inside the fuel cell. This may be accomplished with adequate temperature distribution along the cathode channel, which would require a specific design of the fuel cell in terms of spatially variable heat transfer rates, and corresponding control of the cooling subsystem. In order to determine whether the proposed concept would result in longer life of fuel cell, some basic understanding of causes of fuel cell degradation is needed, particularly related to water and heat management. Particularly, it is proposed to investigate heat transfer in nano-structured catalyst layer because inadequate heat removal from the electrochemical reaction sites may be one of the causes for fuel cell degradation. Other stressors will be studied as well, and procedures for accelerated durability testing will be established, in order to confirm that the proposed concept of water and heat management is beneficial to fuel cell durability. The proposed research is expected to improve understanding of water and heat transfer in PEM fuel cell, including the effects that dry conditions and inadequate heat removal from the catalyst sites may have on fuel cell durability. This novel concept of variable temperature along the cathode channel would result in simplification of the fuel cell support system by eliminating the devices needed for external humidification, without affecting fuel cell performance and durability in various applications. 					 				|	|Mechnical engineering|	|PEM fuel cell, temperature control, humidity of reactant gases, durability stressors, decay mechanisms|

The approach known as Tartar's programme proved particularly convenient for partial differential equations modelling physical laws; the basic assumption being that weak convergences of sequences of solutions model the transition from microscale to macroscale. Of importance are also mathematical objects being, in a generalised sense, accumulation points of weakly convergent sequences, such as defect measures or H-measures. The research will be directed towards improving the existing weak convergence methods, designing new mathematical objects for that purpose, as well as developing new methods, with particular attention paid to their applications to practical problems. Problems known as homogenisation are tied to properties of mixtures of materials, with important applications in optimal design. Problems related to evolutionary equations and their admissibility conditions mainly concern transport problems in free and porous media, where it is sometimes natural to include continuous time random walk variables in the model. Such problems sometimes also lead to fractional derivative equations. Some problems are related to hyperbolic conservation laws and the propagation and interaction of singularities. High-frequency waves corresponding to solutions of hyperbolic systems are governed by ODEs, allowing for final interpretation as particles. Particularly interesting are situations where the equation changes its type (like transonic fluid flow), motivating our interest in Friedrichs systems. Further results for semilinear systems could open a new approach to the Maxwell-Dirac system, with potential applications in quantum field theory. Practical computation of coefficients in specific applications is also important; as the unknown functions have the domain in multidimensional space, quite often more efficient numerical methods have to be developed. 					 				|	|Mathematics|	|weak convergences, partial differential equation, homogenisation, optimal design, H-measures, semiclassical measures, transport problems|

The best approach to control FHB and to reduce mycotoxin contamination is to create wheat genotypes which are carrying effective resistance genes. The purpose of this project is to find the wheat genotypes that have a certain level of resistance to FHB infections. Macroconidia treatment will be carried out at 50 winter wheat genotypes at the time of flowering in the first year of investigation. Disease incidence and intensity will be measured in a couple of occasions to calculate area under disease curve. For further research 25 wheat genotypes will be selected based on the lower disease incidence and intensity and artificially inoculated in the second and third year of investigation. In each year, after harvest we will determine grain yield, test weight, 1000 kernel weight, protein content, gluten content, sedimentation value and rheological parameters of wheat flour. DON, T-2 and HT-2 toxin, nivalenol, diacetoksiscirpenol, fuzarenon X and zearalenone will be analysed in wheat grain and wheat malt. To obtain reliable information on the impact of artificial inoculation on quality of wheat genotype, it is necessary to study (except chemical and rheological parameters of quality) the composition and quantity of wheat proteins, with emphasis on gliadins (?-, ?- ?-) and glutenins (HMW-GS and LMW-GS). Several antioxidant enzymes (guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase) will be screened in a few occasions in order to find their potential correlation with plant resistance mechanisms to the pathogen attack. We will also check accumulation of free proline and malondialdehyde content. 					 				|	|Agriculture|	|wheat, fusarium, yield, quality, mycotoxins, antioxidative activity|

The properties will be primary adjusted for use in photovoltaic solar cells while results will be applicable for other opto-electronic devices, sensors, catalysts etc. Project activities assume study of correlation between details of (nano)structural properties with optical, vibrational and electrical from one side and correlation between structure and parameters of deposition from other side. This will enable test of theoretical predictions related to defects and low dimensional structures and models of thin film growth as well. The main challenge is nano-structures elongated in the direction perpendicular to the surface, based on one type of oxide while decorated with other type of oxide. By using these structures significant increase the efficiency of photovoltaic cells is expected. Two basic preparation techniques will be used: (i) chemical methods and (ii) vacuum deposition by magnetrons sputtering and pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The chemical methods (including sol-gel technique and hydrothermal syntheses) enable relatively simple formation of various nano-structures (e. g. nano-crystals, nano-wires, nano-sheets, nano-tubes) providing larger flexibility for optimization of the preparation, and better statistics for understanding the correlation between nano-structure and properties. On the other hand, photovoltaic solar cells assume deposition of the films on large areas and for this purpose magnetron sputtering and PLD seem more suitable. Furthermore, the surface modification by plasma treatment looks appealing in combination with vacuum deposition techniques or PLD. That is why the optimal structural properties found by chemical methods will be goal to be obtained by magnetron sputtering or PLD techniques. Project will be partially devoted to education of the PhD and Postdoc. students. 					 				|	|Physics|	|zinc oxide, titanium diokside, nanocomposites, photovoltaic solar cells, chemical methods, magnetrons sputtering and pulsed laser deposition|
